**Note:** General support includes security vulnerability resolutions and critical bug fixes in all supported minor versions, while other maintenance is applied only to the latest supported minor release.

## <a id="topic_whatsnew" class="no-quick-link"></a>What's New in Pivotal GemFire 9.1

- Pivotal GemFire 9.1 is based on Apache Geode version 1.2.0.
Pivotal GemFire 9.1 and Apache Geode share a common set of
documentation. 
Therefore, references to both GemFire and Apache Geode appear throughout 
this documentation; consider them equivalents.

- A fully-integrated Lucene text search using indexes.
See [Apache Lucene Integration](/geode/tools_modules/lucene_integration.html).

- Improved the resiliency of servers during SSL handshake.

- A provided `PartitionResolver` enables the colocation of related
data without writing and deploying a custom partition resolver.

- There is a `gfsh import` option to invoke callbacks such as CacheListeners
when importing a region snapshot file.

## <a id="UpgradingGF91" class="no-quick-link"></a>Upgrading to Pivotal GemFire 9.1

To upgrade from an earlier version of GemFire to the current version, see [Upgrading Pivotal GemFire](../getting_started/upgrade/upgrade_from_overview.html).

Note that a modified restart of servers within clusters that are 
upgraded to GemFire version 9.1.1 
or a more recent version from a version prior to version 9.1.1
will be needed
if the `SecurityManager` interface has been implemented
and the clients have not been upgraded.
Further, once those clients have been upgraded to GemFire 9.1.1
or a more recent version,
all servers will need to be restarted.
