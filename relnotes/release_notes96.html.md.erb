## <a id="UpgradingGF96" class="no-quick-link"></a>Upgrading to Pivotal GemFire 9.6

To upgrade from an earlier version of GemFire to the current version, see [Upgrading Pivotal GemFire](../getting_started/upgrade/upgrade_overview.html).

When servers are upgraded to this GemFire version from a version prior to version 9.1.1,
their authentication of client messages is disabled in order to facilitate rolling upgrades.
If your clients are set up to send authenticated messages, the servers will honor those messages,
but will not enforce authentication until you reinstate authentication on each of the upgraded servers.

To reinstate secure client/server messaging, restart each server with
the `geode.disallow-internal-messages-without-credentials` system property set to `true`.
For example:

``` pre
gfsh>start server --name=server_name --dir=server_config_dir \
--J=-Dgeode.disallow-internal-messages-without-credentials=true
```
