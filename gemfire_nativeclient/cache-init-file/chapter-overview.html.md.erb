title:  Cache Initialization File (cache.xml)
---

To ease the task of managing the structure of the cache, you can define the default Pivotal GemFire cache structure in an XML-based initialization file.

To modify the cache structure, you just edit `cache.xml` in your preferred text editor. No changes to the application code are required.

This chapter describes the file format of the `cache.xml` file and discusses its contents.

-   **[Cache Initialization File Basics](../../gemfire_nativeclient/cache-init-file/file-basics.html)**

    The contents of the cache initialization file are used to populate or update a cache.

-   **[Example cache.xml File](../../gemfire_nativeclient/cache-init-file/example-cache-file.html)**

    An example `cache.xml` file shows cache and region initialization for a client. The example shows only a subset of the possible data configurations.

-   **[Native Client Cache XML DTD](../../gemfire_nativeclient/cache-init-file/cache-dtd.html)**

    The contents of the cache initialization file must conform to the data type definitions in `gfcpp-cache8000.dtd`.
