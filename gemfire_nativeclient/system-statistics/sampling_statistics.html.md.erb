title:  Sampling Statistics
---

When applications and cache servers join a distributed system, they indicate whether to enable statistics sampling and whether to archive the statistics that are gathered.

The following statistics are related to the statistic sampler.

|               |                                                |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `sampleCount` | Total number of samples taken by this sampler. |
| `sampleTime`  | Total amount of time spent taking samples.     |
| `StatSampler` | Statistics on the statistic sampler.           |
