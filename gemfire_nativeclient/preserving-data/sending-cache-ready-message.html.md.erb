title:  Sending Cache Ready Messages to the Server
---

After a durable client connects and initializes its cache, regions, cache listeners, and any interest registration, it invokes `readyForEvents` to indicate to the servers that the client is ready to receive any messages accumulated for it.

## Durable Client Cache Ready Notification (C++)

The following example shows how to call `readyForEvents`.

``` pre
//Send ready for event message to server(only for durable clients).
//Server will send queued events to client after receiving this.
cachePtr->readyForEvents();
```

To keep the client from losing events, do not call this method until all regions and listeners are created. For more information, see [Reconnection](reconnection.html#concept_38C027837216434CB5DEC84DF56B807E).
