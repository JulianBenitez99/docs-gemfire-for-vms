title:  Creating a Region
---

To create a region, you create a `RegionFactory` using the `RegionShortcut` that most closely fits your region configuration.

From that point, you customize the settings for region attributes as needed.

Creating a region using the native client API only creates a proxy client side region. A corresponding region with the same name and path must also exist on the servers that have been configured for client connections and upon which the client will perform its operations.

## Creating a CACHING\_PROXY Region

This example creates a region using a CACHING\_PROXY RegionShortcut with no further modifications:

``` pre
RegionFactory regionFactory =
cache.CreateRegionFactory(RegionShortcut.CACHING_PROXY);
 
IRegion<string, string> region = regionFactory
.Create<string, string>("exampleRegion");
```

## Creating a CACHING\_PROXY Region with LRU

This example creates a region based on the CACHING\_PROXY RegionShortcut with two additional region attributes settings. For information on the settings, see [Region Attributes Descriptions](../client-cache/region-attributes-desc.html#region-attributes-desc).

``` pre
RegionFactory regionFactory =
cache.CreateRegionFactory(RegionShortcut.CACHING_PROXY);
// Create the example Region programmatically.
IRegion<string, string> region = regionFactory
.SetLruEntriesLimit(20000)
.SetInitialCapacity(20000)
.Create<string, string>("exampleRegion");
```
