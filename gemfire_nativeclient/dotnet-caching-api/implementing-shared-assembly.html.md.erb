title:  Implementing the Shared Assembly

Follow these steps to install the shared assembly into the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).

1.  Go to the `NativeClient_xxxx` directory.

    ``` pre
    cd %GFCPP%
    ```

2.  Run the GAC utility to install `GemStone.GemFire.Cache.dll` into the GAC.

    ``` pre
    gacutil.exe /if GemStone.GemFire.Cache.dll
    ```

When you are ready to uninstall, use the `/u` switch. More information on the GAC utility can be found at [http://www.msdn.com](https://msdn.microsoft.com), or by using `gacutil.exe                 /?`.
