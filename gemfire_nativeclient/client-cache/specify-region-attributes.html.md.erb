title:  Specifying Region Attributes
---

Region attributes govern the automated management of a region and its entries.

Specify region attributes before creating the region. You can do this either through the declarative XML file or through the API. The API includes classes for defining a region's attributes before creation and for modifying some of them after creation. For details, see the online API documentation for `RegionShortcut`, `RegionAttributes`, `AttributesFactory`, and `AttributesMutator`.
