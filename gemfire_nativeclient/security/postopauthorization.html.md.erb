title:  Post-Operative Authorization
---

Authorization in the post-operation phase occurs on the server after the operation is complete and before the results are sent to the client.

The callback can modify the results of certain operations, such as `query`, `get` and `keySet`, or even completely disallow the operation. For example, a post-operation callback for a query operation can filter out sensitive data or data that the client should not receive, or even completely fail the operation.

The `security-client-accessor-pp` system property in the serverâ€™s `gemfire.properties` file specifies the callback to invoke in the post-operation phase. For example:

`security-client-accessor-pp=templates.security.XmlAuthorization.create`
