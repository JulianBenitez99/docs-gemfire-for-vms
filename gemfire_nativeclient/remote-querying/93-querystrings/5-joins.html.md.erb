title:  Joins

If collections in the `FROM` clause are not related to each other, you can use the `WHERE` clause to join them.

The statement below returns all the persons from the `/Persons` region with the same name as a flower in the `/Flowers` region.

``` pre
SELECT DISTINCT p FROM /Persons p, /Flowers f WHERE p.name = f.name
```

Indexes are supported for region joins. To create indexes for region joins, you create single-region indexes for both sides of the join condition. These are used during query execution for the join condition.
