title:  Configuring PDX to Ignore Unread Fields During Deserialization
---

Use the `setPdxIgnoreUnreadFields` API to control whether PDX ignores fields that were unread during deserialization.

The default is to preserve unread fields by including their data during serialization. However, if you configure the cache to ignore unread fields then their data will be lost during serialization.

You should only set this attribute to `true` if you know this member will only be reading cache data. In this use case you do not need to pay the cost of preserving unread fields since you will never reserialize the PDX data.

For example:

``` pre
CacheFactoryPtr cfPtr = CacheFactory::createCacheFactory(PropertiesObj);
cfPtr->setPdxReadSerialized(tue);
cfPtr->setPdxIgnoreUnreadFields(false);
cachePtr = cfPtr->create();
```
