title:  Remote Query API
---

You use the native client querying API to access all the querying functionality discussed in the previous sections.

This section gives a general overview of the interfaces and classes that are provided by the Query package API, and the shortcut methods provided in the Region interface. For complete, current information on the classes and interfaces discussed here, see the native client API documentation.

-   **[Creating and Managing Queries](../../../nativeclient/remote-querying/95-remotequeryapi/2-create-manage-queries.html)**

    You create queries on the cache server by obtaining a `QueryService` method and manage them through the resulting `Query` object. The `Region` interface has several shortcut query methods.

-   **[Query Result Sets](../../../nativeclient/remote-querying/95-remotequeryapi/3-query-result-sets.html)**

-   **[Query Code Samples Returning ResultSet](../../../nativeclient/remote-querying/96-progexamples/2-query-code-examples-resultset.html)**

    API examples demonstrate methods for returning `ResultSet` for both built-in and user-fined data types.

-   **[Query Code Samples Returning StructSet](../../../nativeclient/remote-querying/96-progexamples/3-query-code-examples-structset.html)**

    These examples return a `StructSet` for built-in and user-defined data types, `Struct` objects, and collections.
