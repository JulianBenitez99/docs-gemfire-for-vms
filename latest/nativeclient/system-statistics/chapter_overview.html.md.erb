title:  System Statistics
---

*System Statistics* provides information on the Pivotal GemFire installation and includes standard statistics for caching and distribution activities.

Statistics that end with "time" are time-based statistics. For performance reasons, by default, the system does not collect these. To enable time-based statistics gathering, set the system property` enable-time-statistics` in [Attributes in gfcpp.properties—Statistics Archiving Properties](../setting-properties/attributes-gfcpp.html#attributes-gfcpp__table_E1A0EDBA67CD41319E1E5FD0A0BB2723).

-   **[Sampling Statistics](../../nativeclient/system-statistics/sampling_statistics.html)**

    When applications and cache servers join a distributed system, they indicate whether to enable statistics sampling and whether to archive the statistics that are gathered.

-   **[System Performance Statistics](../../nativeclient/system-statistics/system_performance_statistics.html)**

    Performance statistics are collected for each application or cache server that connects to a distributed system.

-   **[Operating System Statistics](../../nativeclient/system-statistics/operating_system_statistics.html)**

    Use operating system statistics to determine a member’s CPU, memory, and disk usage.
