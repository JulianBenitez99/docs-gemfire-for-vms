title:  Serializing and Accessing Data as a Blob
---

If you have data that is best handled as a blob, such as structs that do not contain pointers, use the serializable type `CacheableBytes` . `CacheableBytes` is a blob class that implements the serialization for you.

`CacheableBytes` also provides direct access to the blob data. Because it is not derived from the `CacheableKey` interface, `CacheableBytes` enables you to modify data in place and then put it into the region again to distribute the change.

For more information, see the API documentation for `CacheableBytes.`
