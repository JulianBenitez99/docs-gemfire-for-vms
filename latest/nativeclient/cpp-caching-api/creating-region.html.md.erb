title:  Creating a Proxy Client-Side Region
---

This section provides code examples for creating and customizing proxy client-side regions.

**Note:**
Creating a region through the native client API only creates a proxy client-side region. A corresponding region with the same name and path should also exist on the servers that have been configured for client connections and upon which the client will perform its operations.

To create a region, you create a `RegionFactory` using the `RegionShortcut` that most closely fits your region configuration. From that, create your region, customizing the settings as region attributes as needed.

## Creating a CACHING\_PROXY Region

This example creates a region using a CACHING\_PROXY `RegionShortcut` with no further modifications:

``` pre
RegionFactoryPtr regionFactory = 
            cachePtr->createRegionFactory(CACHING_PROXY);
regionPtr = regionFactory ->create("exampleRegion");
```

## Creating a CACHING\_PROXY Region with LRU

This example creates a region based on the CACHING\_PROXY RegionShortcut with two additional region attributes settings. For information on the settings, see [Region Attributes Descriptions](../client-cache/region-attributes-desc.html#region-attributes-desc).

``` pre
RegionFactoryPtr regionFactory = 
              cachePtr->createRegionFactory(CACHING_PROXY);
regionPtr = regionFactory->setLruEntriesLimit( 20000 )
              ->setInitialCapacity( 20000 )
              ->create("exampleRegion");
```
