title:  Creating a Cache
---

The code snippets in this section show cache creation.

When you create your cache, the system automatically connects your process to the server tier. For systems with security enabled, the credentials for a connecting client are authenticated when it creates the cache. See [Security](../security/overviewsecurity.html#security) for more information about authenticated connections.

## Creating the System Connection and the Cache

In this example, the application creates the cache by calling the `CacheFactory::create` function, specifying the servers to connect to:

``` pre
CacheFactoryPtr cacheFactory = CacheFactory::createCacheFactory();
    CachePtr cachePtr = cacheFactory  
                        ->addServer("localhost", 40404)
                        ->addServer("localhost", 40405)
                        ->setSubscriptionEnabled(true)
                        ->create();
```
