title:  Interoperability of Language Classes and Types
---

*Interoperability of Language Classes and Types* provides a table that maps C++ class methods to corresponding .NET class methods and a table that maps Java types to .NET types.

-   **[C++ Class to .NET Class Mappings](../../nativeclient/type_mappings/cpp-class-to-dotnet-class-mappings.html)**

    Wherever the native C++ class methods use pass-by-reference semantics to return data, the corresponding .NET methods shown in the following table return the object instead of using pass-by-reference semantics.

-   **[Java to .NET Type Mapping Table](../../nativeclient/type_mappings/java-to-dotnet-type-mapping.html)**

    The following table provides a mapping between Java and .NET types.
