The initial startup of a durable client is similar to the startup of any other client, except that it specifically calls the `Cache.readyForEvents` method when all regions and listeners on the client are ready to process messages from the server.

See [Sending the Cache Ready Message to the Server](sending-cache-ready-message.html#concept_C28D015FA85B4EE4B2F8D2DA5FCAFBFF).
