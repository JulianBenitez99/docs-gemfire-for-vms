title:  Life Cycle of a Durable Client
---

This section discusses the high-level operation of a durable client through initial startup, disconnection, and reconnection.

-   **[Initial Operation](../../nativeclient/preserving-data/initial-operation.html)**

    The initial startup of a durable client is similar to the startup of any other client, except that it specifically calls the `Cache.readyForEvents` method when all regions and listeners on the client are ready to process messages from the server.

-   **[Disconnection](../../nativeclient/preserving-data/disconnection.html)**

    While the client and servers are disconnected, their operation varies depending on the circumstances.

-   **[Reconnection](../../nativeclient/preserving-data/reconnection.html)**

    During initialization, operations on the client cache can come from multiple sources.

-   **[Durable Message Replay](../../nativeclient/preserving-data/durable-message-replay.html)**

    When the primary server receives the cache ready message, the servers and client execute a procedure to update the queue and replay the events from the stored messages.

-   **[Application Operations During Interest Registration](../../nativeclient/preserving-data/app-ops-during-int-reg.html)**

    As soon as the client creates its regions, the application hosting the client can start cache operations, even while the client is still receiving its interest registration responses.
