title:  Using GemStone.GemFire.Cache.dll As a Private Assembly
---

To access `GemStone.GemFire.Cache.dll` as a private assembly, you need to specify a `.config` file for your application.

The file needs to be the same name as your application, with a `.config` suffix. For example, the `.config` file for `main.exe` would be `main.exe.config`. The two files must reside in the same directory.

Follow these steps to create a `.config` file:

1.  Copy `%GFCPP%/docs/default.exe.config` to the appropriate location.
2.  Rename `default.exe.config` to the name of your application.
3.  Change the `href` attribute of the `CodeBase` element to point to your `GemStone.GemFire.Cache.dll` file. Any of three path types – http, relative, or absolute – will work.

## A Sample .config File

The following example shows an excerpt of a `.config` file. The `PublicKeyToken` value is only an example, and the codebase version value is not set correctly. See `%GFCPP%/docs/default.exe.config` for an actual example for this release.

``` pre
<configuration>
   <runtime>
      <assemblyBinding
         xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1">
         <dependentAssembly>
            <assemblyIdentity name="GemStone.GemFire.Cache"
               publicKeyToken="126e6338d9f55e0c"
               culture="neutral" />
            <codeBase version="0.0.0.0"
               href="../../bin/GemStone.GemFire.Cache.dll"/>
         </dependentAssembly>
      </assemblyBinding>
   </runtime>
</configuration>
```

**Note:**
If the `.config` file contain errors, no warning or error messages are issued. The application runs as if no `.config` file is present.
