title:  Closing the Cache
---

Use the `Cache::close` function to release system resources when you finish using the cache.

After the cache is closed, any further method calls on the cache or any region object result in a `CacheClosedException` .

If the cache is in a durable client, you need to use the `keepalive` version of the close method. See [Disconnecting From the Server](../preserving-data/disconnecting-from-server.html#concept_3A9AC62F96FA44DBBB5CCBFD3EA19B56).
