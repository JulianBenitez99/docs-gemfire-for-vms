title:  Deploying Configuration Files without the Cluster Configuration Service
---

You can deploy your <span class="keyword">Apache Geode</span> configuration files in your system directory structure or in jar files. You determine how you want to deploy your configuration files and set them up accordingly.

**Note:**
If you use the cluster configuration service to create and manage your <span class="keyword">Apache Geode</span> cluster configuration, the procedures described in this section are not needed because <span class="keyword">Geode</span> automatically manages the distribution of the configuration files and jar files to members of the cluster. See [Overview of the Cluster Configuration Service](../cluster_config/gfsh_persist.html).

You can use the procedures described in this section to distribute configurations that are member-specific, or for situations where you do not want to use the cluster configuration service.

-   **[Main Steps to Deploying Configuration Files](../../configuring/running/deploy_config_files_intro.html)**

    These are the basic steps for deploying configuration files, with related detail in sections that follow.

-   **[Default File Specifications and Search Locations](../../configuring/running/default_file_specs.html)**

    Each file has a default name, a set of file search locations, and a system property you can use to override the defaults.

-   **[Changing the File Specifications](../../configuring/running/change_file_spec.html)**

    You can change all file specifications in the `gemfire.properties` file and at the command line.

-   **[Deploying Configuration Files in JAR Files](../../configuring/running/deploying_config_jar_files.html)**

    This section provides a procedure and an example for deploying configuration files in JAR files.
