title:  Loading Existing Configuration Files into Cluster Configuration
---

To load an existing cache.xml or gemfire.properties configuration file into a new cluster, use the `--load-cluster-configuration-from-dir` parameter when starting up the locator.

You can use this technique to migrate a single server's configuration into the cluster configuration service. To load an existing cache.xml file or cluster configuration into a cluster, perform the following steps:

1.  Make sure the locator is not currently running.
2.  Within the locator's working directory, create a `cluster_config/cluster` directory if the directory does not already exist.
3.  Copy the desired configuration files (cache.xml or gemfire.properties, or both) into the `cluster_config/cluster` directory.
4.  Rename the configuration files as follows:
    -   Rename `cache.xml` to `cluster.xml`
    -   Rename `gemfire.properties` to `cluster.properties`

5.  Start the locator in gfsh as follows:

    ``` pre
    gfsh>start locator --name=<locator_name> --enable-cluster-configuration=true --load-cluster-configuration-from-dir=true
    ```

    After successful startup, the locator should report that the "Cluster configuration service is up and running." Any servers that join this cluster and have `--use-cluster-configuration` set to true will pick up these configuration files.

**Note:**
If you make any manual modifications to the cluster.xml or cluster.properties (or group\_name.xml or group\_name.properties) files, you must stop the locator and then restart the locator using the `--load-cluster-configuration-from-dir` parameter. Direct file modifications are not picked up iby the cluster configuration service without a locator restart.
