title:  Topology and Communication General Concepts
---

Before you configure your <span class="keyword">Pivotal GemFire</span> members, make sure you understand the options for topology and communication.

-   **[Topology Types](../../../latest/topologies_and_comm/topology_concepts/topology_types.html)**

    The <span class="keyword">Pivotal GemFire</span> topology options allow you to scale horizontally and vertically.

-   **[Planning Topology and Communication](../../../latest/topologies_and_comm/topology_concepts/member_communication.html)**

    Create a topology plan and a detailed list of machines and communication ports that your members will use. Configure your <span class="keyword">Pivotal GemFire</span> systems and the communication between systems.

-   **[How Member Discovery Works](../../../latest/topologies_and_comm/topology_concepts/how_member_discovery_works.html)**

    <span class="keyword">Pivotal GemFire</span> provides various options for member discovery within a distributed system and between clients and servers.

-   **[How Communication Works](../../../latest/topologies_and_comm/topology_concepts/how_communication_works.html)**

    <span class="keyword">GemFire</span> uses a combination of TCP and UDP unicast and multicast for communication between members. You can change the default behavior to optimize communication for your system.

-   **[Using Bind Addresses](../../../latest/topologies_and_comm/topology_concepts/using_bind_addresses.html)**

    You use a bind address configuration to send network traffic through non-default network cards and to distribute the load of network traffic for <span class="keyword">GemFire</span> across multiple cards. If no bind address setting is found, <span class="keyword">GemFire</span> uses the host machine's default address.

-   **[Choosing Between IPv4 and IPv6](../../../latest/topologies_and_comm/topology_concepts/IPv4_and_IPv6.html)**

    By default, <span class="keyword">Pivotal GemFire</span> uses Internet Protocol version 4 for <span class="keyword">GemFire</span> address specifications. You can switch to Internet Protocol version 6 if all your machines support it. You may lose performance, so you need to understand the costs of making the switch.
