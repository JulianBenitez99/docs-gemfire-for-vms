title:  Configuring Peer-to-Peer Discovery
---

Peer members discover each other using one or more locators.

<a id="setting_up_membership__section_8C0147A16D5A488FB9C0EB765BDEC07B"></a>
The `gemfire.properties` file can list the locators:

``` pre
locators=<locator1-address>[<port1>],<locator2-address>[<port2>]
```

To run a standalone member, the `gemfire.properties` file disables using locators:

``` pre
locators=
mcast-address=                    
mcast-port=0
```

**Note:**
Locator settings must be consistent throughout the distributed system.
