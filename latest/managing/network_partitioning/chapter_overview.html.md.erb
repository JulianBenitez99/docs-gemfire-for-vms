-   **[Failure Detection and Membership Views](../../../latest/managing/network_partitioning/failure_detection.html)**

    <span class="keyword">GemFire</span> uses failure detection to remove unresponsive members from membership views.

-   **[Membership Coordinators, Lead Members and Member Weighting](../../../latest/managing/network_partitioning/membership_coordinators_lead_members_and_weighting.html)**

    Network partition detection uses a designated membership coordinator and a weighting system that accounts for a lead member to determine whether a network partition has occurred.
