SSL protects your data in transit between applications.

-   **[How SSL Works](../../managing/security/how_ssl_works.html)**

    For in transit data, SSL ensures that only the applications identified by you can share distributed system data.

-   **[Configuring SSL](../../managing/security/implementing_ssl.html)**

    You configure SSL for mutual authentication between members and to protect your data during distribution. You can use SSL alone or in conjunction with the other <span class="keyword">Geode</span> security options.
