---

<span class="keyword">Pivotal GemFire</span> includes a range of built-in authentication and authorization features. It also accommodates security infrastructure plug-ins.

<span class="keyword">GemFire</span> provides member authentication and cache access authorization with these features:

-   **Flexible plug-in framework**. Plug-in mechanism for authentication of clients and servers and authorization of cache operations from clients. Any security infrastructure can be plugged into the system as long as the plug-ins implement the required <span class="keyword">GemFire</span> interfaces.
-   **Cache server authentication**. Allows peer cache servers into the distributed system if their credentials are authenticated by the locator to which they connect.
-   **Client authentication**. Implemented through authentication of clientâ€™s credentials by a cache server when the client attempts to connect to the server. Multiple users can connect, with separate authorization levels, from within one client application.
-   **SSL-based authentication**. Allows configuration of connections to be SSL- based, rather than plain socket connections. <span class="keyword">GemFire</span> enables you to configure SSL separately for peer-to-peer, client, JMX, and HTTP connections.
-   **Authorization of cache operations**. Selectively authorized cache operations by clients based on the predefined, associated roles, where the credentials are provided by the client when connecting to the server.
-   **Data modification based on authorization**. Allows authorization callbacks to modify or filter data sent from the client to the server. Similarly, after the cache operations complete on the server, a post authorization callback occurs, that can filter or modify results sent to the client. However, the results cannot be modified while using function execution.
-   **Sample implementations**. Authentication and authorization sample implementations.
