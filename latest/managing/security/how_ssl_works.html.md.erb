title:  How SSL Works
---

For in transit data, SSL ensures that only the applications identified by you can share distributed system data.

To be secure, the data that is cached in a <span class="keyword">Geode</span> system must be protected during storage, distribution, and processing. At any time, data in a distributed system may be in one or more of these locations:

-   In memory
-   On disk
-   In transit between processes (for example, in an internet or intranet)

For the protection of data in memory or on disk, <span class="keyword">Geode</span> relies on your standard system security features such as firewalls, operating system settings, and JDK security settings.

The SSL implementation ensures that only the applications identified by you can share distributed system data in transit. In this figure, the data in the visible portion of the distributed system is secured by the firewall and by security settings in the operating system and in the JDK. The data in the disk files, for example, is protected by the firewall and by file permissions. Using SSL for data distribution provides secure communication between <span class="keyword">Geode</span> system members inside and outside the firewalls.
