title:  Where to Place Security Settings
---

Restrict access to security configuration data by placing related properties (beginning with `security-*`) in a separate file.

You can move security settings that are normally configured in `gemfire.properties` to a separate `gfsecurity.properties` file. This way, you can still allow read or write access for your `gemfire.properties` file.

Upon startup, <span class="keyword">GemFire</span> processes will look for the `gfsecurity.properties` file in the following locations in order:

-   current working directory
-   user's home directory
-   classpath

If any password-related security properties are listed in the file but have a blank value, the process will prompt the user to enter a password upon startup.
