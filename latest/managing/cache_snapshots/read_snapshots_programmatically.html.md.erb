title:  Reading Snapshots Programmatically
---

You can read a snapshot entry-by-entry for further processing or transformation into other formats.

The following is an example of a snapshot reader that processes entries from a previously generated snapshot file.

``` pre
File mySnapshot = ...
SnapshotIterator<String, MyObject> iter = SnapshotReader.read(mySnapshot);
try {
  while (iter.hasNext()) {
    Entry<String, MyObject> entry = iter.next();

    String key = entry.getKey();
    MyObject value = entry.getValue();

    System.out.println(key + " = " + value);
  }
} finally {
  iter.close();
}
```
