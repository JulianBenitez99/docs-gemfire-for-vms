title:  Configuring RMI Registry Ports and RMI Connectors
---

<span class="keyword">Geode</span> programmatically emulates out-of-the-box JMX provided by Java and creates a JMXServiceURL with RMI Registry and RMI Connector ports on all manageable members.

## Configuring JMX Manager Port and Bind Addresses

You can configure a specific connection port and address when launching a process that will host the <span class="keyword">Geode</span> JMX Manager. To do this, specify values for the `jmx-manager-bind-address`, which specifies the JMX manager's IP address and `jmx-manager-port`, which defines the RMI connection port.

The default <span class="keyword">Geode</span> JMX Manager RMI port is 1099. You may need to modify this default if 1099 is reserved for other uses.

## Using Out-of-the-Box RMI Connectors

If for some reason you need to use standard JMX RMI in your deployment for other monitoring purposes, set the <span class="keyword">Geode</span> property `jmx-manager-port` to 0 on any members where you want to use standard JMX RMI.

If you use out-of-the-box JMX RMI instead of starting an embedded <span class="keyword">Geode</span> JMX Manager, you should consider setting `-Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=Long.MAX_VALUE-1` when starting the JVM for customer applications and client processes. Every <span class="keyword">Geode</span> process internally sets this setting before creating and starting the JMX RMI connector in order to prevent full garbage collection from pausing processes.
