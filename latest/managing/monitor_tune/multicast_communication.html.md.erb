title:  Multicast Communication

You can make configuration adjustments to improve the UDP multicast performance of peer-to-peer communication in your <span class="keyword">Geode</span> system.

Before you begin, you should understand <span class="keyword">Geode</span> [Basic Configuration and Programming](../../basic_config/book_intro.html). See also the general communication tuning and UDP tuning covered in [Socket Communication](socket_communication.html) and [UDP Communication](udp_communication.html#udp_comm).

-   **[Provisioning Bandwidth for Multicast](../../managing/monitor_tune/multicast_communication_provisioning_bandwidth.html)**

    Multicast installations require more planning and configuration than TCP installations. With IP multicast, you gain scalability but lose the administrative convenience of TCP.

-   **[Testing Multicast Speed Limits](../../managing/monitor_tune/multicast_communication_testing_multicast_speed_limits.html)**

    TCP automatically adjusts its speed to the capability of the processes using it and enforces bandwidth sharing so that every process gets a turn. With multicast, you must determine and explicitly set those limits.

-   **[Configuring Multicast Speed Limits](../../managing/monitor_tune/multicast_communication_configuring_speed_limits.html)**

    After you determine the maximum transmission rate, configure and tune your production system.

-   **[Run-time Considerations for Multicast](../../managing/monitor_tune/multicast_communication_runtime_considerations.html)**

    When you use multicast for messaging and data distribution, you need to understand how the health monitoring setting works and how to control memory use.

-   **[Troubleshooting the Multicast Tuning Process](../../managing/monitor_tune/multicast_communication_troubleshooting.html)**

    Several problems may arise during the initial testing and tuning process for multicasting.
