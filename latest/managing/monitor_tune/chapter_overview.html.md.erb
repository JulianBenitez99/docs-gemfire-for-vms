A collection of tools and controls allow you to monitor and adjust <span class="keyword">Pivotal GemFire</span> performance.

-   **[Improving GemFire Performance on vSphere](../../../latest/managing/monitor_tune/gemfire_performance_on_vsphere.html)**

    This topic provides guidelines for tuning vSphere virtualized environments that host <span class="keyword">Pivotal GemFire</span> deployments.

-   **[Performance Controls](../../../latest/managing/monitor_tune/performance_controls.html)**

    This topic provides tuning suggestions of particular interest to developers, primarily programming techniques and cache configuration.

-   **[System Member Performance](../../../latest/managing/monitor_tune/system_member_performance.html)**

    You can modify some configuration parameters to improve system member performance.

-   **[Slow Receivers with TCP/IP](../../../latest/managing/monitor_tune/slow_receivers.html)**

    You have several options for preventing situations that can cause slow receivers of data distributions. The slow receiver options control only peer-to-peer communication using TCP/IP. This discussion does not apply to client/server or multi-site communication, or to communication using the UDP unicast or multicast protocols.

-   **[Slow distributed-ack Messages](../../../latest/managing/monitor_tune/slow_messages.html)**

    In systems with distributed-ack regions, a sudden large number of distributed-no-ack operations can cause distributed-ack operations to take a long time to complete.

-   **[Socket Communication](../../../latest/managing/monitor_tune/socket_communication.html)**

    <span class="keyword">GemFire</span> processes communicate using TCP/IP and UDP unicast and multicast protocols. In all cases, communication uses sockets that you can tune to optimize performance.

-   **[UDP Communication](../../../latest/managing/monitor_tune/udp_communication.html)**

    You can make configuration adjustments to improve multicast and unicast UDP performance of peer-to-peer communication.

-   **[Multicast Communication](../../../latest/managing/monitor_tune/multicast_communication.html)**

    You can make configuration adjustments to improve the UDP multicast performance of peer-to-peer communication in your <span class="keyword">GemFire</span> system.

-   **[Maintaining Cache Consistency](../../../latest/managing/monitor_tune/cache_consistency.html)**

    Maintaining data consistency between caches in a distributed <span class="keyword">GemFire</span> system is vital for ensuring its functional integrity and preventing data loss.
