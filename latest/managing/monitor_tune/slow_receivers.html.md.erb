title:  Slow Receivers with TCP/IP
---

You have several options for preventing situations that can cause slow receivers of data distributions. The slow receiver options control only peer-to-peer communication using TCP/IP. This discussion does not apply to client/server or multi-site communication, or to communication using the UDP unicast or multicast protocols.

Before you begin, you should understand <span class="keyword">GemFire</span> [Basic Configuration and Programming](../../basic_config/book_intro.html).

    During system integration, you can identify and eliminate potential causes of slow receivers in peer-to-peer communication.

-   **[Managing Slow Receivers](../../../latest/managing/monitor_tune/slow_receivers_managing.html)**

    If the receiver fails to receive a message, the sender continues to attempt to deliver the message as long as the receiving member is still in the distributed system.
