The `validate offline-disk-store` command verifies the health of your offline disk store and gives you information about the regions in it, the total entries, and the number of records that would be removed if you compacted the store.

Use this command at these times:

-   Before compacting an offline disk store to help decide whether itâ€™s worth doing.
-   Before restoring or modifying a disk store.
-   Any time you want to be sure the disk store is in good shape.

Example:

``` pre
gfsh>validate offline-disk-store --name=ds1 --disk-dirs=hostB/bupDirectory
```
