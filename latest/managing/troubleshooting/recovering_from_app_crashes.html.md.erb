title:  Recovering from Application and Cache Server Crashes
---

When the application or cache server crashes, its local cache is lost, and any resources it owned (for example, distributed locks) are released. The member must recreate its local cache upon recovery.

    When a member crashes, the remaining members continue operation as though the missing application or cache server had never existed. The recovery process differs according to region type and scope, as well as data redundancy configuration.

    In a client/server configuration, you first make the server available as a member of a distributed system again, and then restart clients as quickly as possible. The client recovers its data from its servers through normal operation.
