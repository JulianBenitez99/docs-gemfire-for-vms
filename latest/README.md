# Project Geode End-User Documentation

The latest check-ins to `project-geode/docs` are automatically built and published to [http://geode-docs.cfapps.io](http://geode-docs.cfapps.io).

Project Geode provides the full source for end-user documentation in DITA XML format. The DITA XML can be built into HTML or PDF output using [Bookbinder](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bookbinder).  

Bookbinder is a gem that binds together a unified documentation web application from markdown, html, and/or DITA source material. The source material for bookbinder must be stored either in local directories or in GitHub repositories. Bookbinder runs [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) to produce a Rackup app that can be deployed locally or as a Web application.

This document contains instructions for building the local Geode documentation and publishing it to Cloud Foundry or Pivotal Web Services. It contains the sections:

## Bookbinder Usage

Bookbinder is meant to be used from within a project called a **book**. The book includes a configuration file that describes which documentation repositories to use as source materials. Bookbinder provides a set of scripts to aggregate those repositories and publish them to various locations.

For project Geode, a preconfigured **book** is provided in the directory `/geode-book`.  You can use this configuration to build HTML for project Geode on your local system.

<a name="prereq"></a>
## Prerequisites

* Bookbinder requires Ruby version 2.0.0-p195 or higher.
* Building DITA documentation in bookbinder requires:
  * Java 1.7
  * Ant
  * [DITA Open Toolkit (DITA-OT) 1.7.5](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dita-ot/files/DITA-OT%20Stable%20Release/DITA%20Open%20Toolkit%201.7/) Install the DITA-OT to a local directory, and reference the top-level toolkit directory in your environment with `PATH_TO_DITA_OT_LIBRARY`. For example:

      $ export PATH_TO_DITA_OT_LIBRARY=/Users/geodeuser/DITA-OT1.7.5

## Building the Documentation

1. Begin by moving or copying the `/geode-book directory` to a directory that is parallel to `project-geode/docs`. For example:

        $ cd /repos/project-geode/docs
        $ cp -r geode-book ..
        $ cd ../geode-book

2. The GemFile in the book directory already defines the `gem "bookbindery"` dependency. Make sure you are in the relocated book directory and enter:

        $ bundle install
     
3. The installed `config.yml` file configures the Project Geode book for building locally.  The installed file configures the local directory for the DITA source files, and identifies the main DITA map file to build. It uses the configuration:

        book_repo: project-geode/geode-book
        public_host: localhost
    
        dita_sections:
        - repository:
            name: project-geode/docs
          directory: docs
          ditamap_location: Geode.ditamap
          subnav_template: geode_subnav.erb
          
        template_variables:
          support_url: http://support.pivotal.io
          product_url: http://pivotal.io/big-data/pivotal-gemfire
          book_title: Project Geode Documentation

4. Build the files locally using the installed `config.yml` file. Execute the command:

        $ bundle exec bookbinder bind local
    
  Bookbinder converts the XML source into HTML, putting the final output in the `final_app` directory.
  
5. To view the local documentation:

        $ cd final_app
        $ rackup
    
  You can now view the local documentation at [http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292)

## Publishing the Documentation
Because the `final_app` directory contains the full output of the HTML conversion process, you can easily publish this directory as a hosted Web application. The instructions that follow describe how to push your local build of the Geode user documentation either to a locally-installed instance of [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](http://cloudfoundry.org/index.html) or to an application instance on [Pivotal Web Services](https://run.pivotal.io/).  

1. Make sure that you have created an account on your local Cloud Foundry instance or on Pivotal Web Services, and that you have installed the latest [cf command line interface](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/installcf/). For example:

        $ cf --version
        cf version 6.10.0-b78bf10-2015-02-11T22:25:45+00:00

2. Log into Cloud Foundry or Pivotal Web Services, specifying the organization and space in which you will push the application. For example:

        $ cf login -u me@mycompany.com -o myorg -s geode-space

3. Change to the `final_app` directory where you built the Geode documentation:

        $ cd /repos/geode-book/final_app
        
4. Use the `cf` command to push the current directory as a new application to a specified host and domain. For example:

        $ cf push geode-docs-build -p . -n my-geode-docs -d example.com 

  The `cf` tool uploads and starts the application, using a default Web server. In the above example, the pushed application becomes available at [http://my-geode-docs.example.com](http://my-geode-docs.example.com).

## Getting More Information

Bookbinder provides additional functionality to construct books from multiple Github repos, to perform variable substitution, and also to automatically build documentation in a continuous integration pipeline.  For more information, see [https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bookbinder](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bookbinder).

The latest check-ins to `project-geode/docs` are automatically built and published to [http://geode-docs.cfapps.io](http://geode-docs.cfapps.io).

For more information about publishing applications to Cloud Foundry, see [Deploying an Application](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html).
