title:  Configure Member Crash Redundancy Recovery for a Partitioned Region
---

Configure whether and how redundancy is recovered in a partition region after a member crashes.

<a id="set_crash_redundancy_recovery__section_86CF741758E54DA29519E9CDDF1BC393"></a>
Use the partition attribute `recovery-delay` to specify member crash redundancy recovery.

| recovery-delay partition attribute | Effect following a member failure                                                    |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -1                                 | No automatic recovery of redundancy following a member failure. This is the default. |
| long greater than or equal to 0    | Number of milliseconds to wait after a member failure before recovering redundancy.  |

By default, redundancy is not recovered after a member crashes. If you expect to quickly restart most crashed members, combining this default setting with member join redundancy recovery can help you avoid unnecessary data shuffling while members are down. By waiting for lost members to rejoin, redundancy recovery is done using the newly started members and partitioning is better balanced with less processing.

Set crash redundancy recovery using one of the following:

-   XML:

    ``` pre
    // Give a crashed member 10 seconds to restart 
    // before recovering redundancy
    <region name="PR1"> 
      <region-attributes refid="PARTITION"> 
        <partition-attributes recovery-delay="10000"/> 
      </region-attributes> 
    </region> 
    ```

-   Java:

    ``` pre
    PartitionAttributes pa = new PartitionAttributesFactory().setRecoveryDelay(10000).create(); 
    ```

-   gfsh:

    ``` pre
    gfsh>create region --name="PR1" type=PARTITION --recovery-delay=10000
    ```
