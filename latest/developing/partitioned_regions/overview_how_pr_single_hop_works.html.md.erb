title:  Configuring Single-Hop Client Access to Server-Partitioned Regions
---

Single-hop data access enables the client pool to track where a partitioned regionâ€™s data is hosted in the servers. To access a single entry, the client directly contacts the server that hosts the key, in a single hop.

    With single-hop access the client connects to every server, so more connections are generally used. This works fine for smaller installations, but is a barrier to scaling.

    Configure your client/server system for direct, single-hop access to partitioned region data in the servers.
