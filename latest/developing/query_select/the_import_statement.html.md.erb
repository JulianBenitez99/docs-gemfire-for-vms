title:  IMPORT Statement
---

It is sometimes necessary for an OQL query to refer to the class of an object. In cases where the same class name resides in two different namescopes (packages), you must be able to differentiate the classes having the same name.

The **IMPORT** statement is used to establish a name for a class in a query.

``` pre
IMPORT package.Position;
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM /exampleRegion, positions.values positions TYPE Position WHERE positions.mktValue >= 25.00
```
