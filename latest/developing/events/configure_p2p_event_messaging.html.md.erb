title:  Configuring Peer-to-Peer Event Messaging
---

You can receive events from distributed system peers for any region that is not a local region. Local regions receive only local cache events.

Peer distribution is done according to the region's configuration.

-   Replicated regions always receive all events from peers and require no further configuration. Replicated regions are configured using the `REPLICATE` region shortcut settings.
-   For non-replicated regions, decide whether you want to receive all entry events from the distributed cache or only events for the data you have stored locally. To configure:
    -   To receive all events, set the `subscription-attributes` `interest-policy` to `all`:

        ``` pre
        <region-attributes> 
            <subscription-attributes interest-policy="all"/> 
        </region-attributes>
        ```

    -   To receive events just for the data you have stored locally, set the `subscription-attributes` `interest-policy` to `cache-content` or do not set it (`cache-content` is the default):

        ``` pre
        <region-attributes> 
            <subscription-attributes interest-policy="cache-content"/> 
        </region-attributes>
        ```

    For partitioned regions, this only affects the receipt of events, as the data is stored according to the region partitioning. Partitioned regions with interest policy of `all` can create network bottlenecks, so if you can, run listeners in every member that hosts the partitioned region data and use the `cache-content` interest policy.

**Note:**
You can also configure Regions using the gfsh command-line interface. See [Region Commands](../../tools_modules/gfsh/quick_ref_commands_by_area.html#topic_EF03119A40EE492984F3B6248596E1DD).
