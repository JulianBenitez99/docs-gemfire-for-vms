# Consistency for Region Updates

<span class="keyword">Geode</span> ensures that all copies of a region eventually reach a consistent state on all members and clients that host the region, including <span class="keyword">Geode</span> members that distribute region events.

    <span class="keyword">Geode</span> performs different consistency checks depending on the type of region you have configured.

    <span class="keyword">Geode</span> enables consistency checking by default. You cannot disable consistency checking for persistent regions. For all other regions, you can explicitly enable or disable consistency checking by setting the `concurrency-checks-enabled` region attribute in `cache.xml` to "true" or "false."

    Consistency checking requires additional overhead for storing and distributing version and timestamp information, as well as for maintaining destroyed entries for a period of time to meet consistency requirements.

    Each region stores version and timestamp information for use in conflict detection. <span class="keyword">Geode</span> members use the recorded information to detect and resolve conflicts consistently before applying a distributed update.

-   **[How Destroy and Clear Operations Are Resolved](../../developing/distributed_regions/how_region_versioning_works.html#topic_321B05044B6641FCAEFABBF5066BD399)**

    When consistency checking is enabled for a region, a <span class="keyword">Geode</span> member does not immediately remove an entry from the region when an application destroys the entry. Instead, the member retains the entry with its current version stamp for a period of time in order to detect possible conflicts with operations that have occurred. The retained entry is referred to as a *tombstone*. <span class="keyword">Geode</span> retains tombstones for partitioned regions and non-replicated regions as well as for replicated regions, in order to provide consistency.

-   **[Transactions with Consistent Regions](../../developing/distributed_regions/how_region_versioning_works.html#topic_32ACFA5542C74F3583ECD30467F352B0)**

    A transaction that modifies a region having consistency checking enabled generates all necessary version information for region updates when the transaction commits.
