title:  Advantages of OQL
---

The following list describes some of the advantages of using an OQL-based querying language:

-   You can query on any arbitrary object
-   You can navigate object collections
-   You can invoke methods and access the behavior of objects
-   Data mapping is supported
-   You are not required to declare types. Since you do not need type definitions, you can work across multiple languages
-   You are not constrained by a schema
