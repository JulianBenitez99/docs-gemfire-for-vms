title:  Advanced Querying
---

This section includes advanced querying topics such as using query indexes, using query bind parameters, querying partitioned regions and query debugging.

-   **[Performance Considerations](../../developing/querying_basics/performance_considerations.html)**

    This topic covers considerations for improving query performance.

-   **[Monitoring Queries for Low Memory](../../developing/querying_basics/monitor_queries_for_low_memory.html)**

    The query monitoring feature prevents out-of-memory exceptions from occurring when you execute queries or create indexes.

-   **[Using Query Bind Parameters](../../developing/query_additional/using_query_bind_parameters.html)**

    Using query bind parameters in <span class="keyword">Geode</span> queries is similar to using prepared statements in SQL where parameters can be set during query execution. This allows user to build a query once and execute it multiple times by passing the query conditions during run time.

-   **[Working with Indexes](../../developing/query_index/query_index.html)**

    The <span class="keyword">Geode</span> query engine supports indexing. An index can provide significant performance gains for query execution.

-   **[Querying Partitioned Regions](../../developing/querying_basics/querying_partitioned_regions.html)**

    <span class="keyword">Geode</span> allows you to manage and store large amounts of data across distributed nodes using partitioned regions. The basic unit of storage for a partitioned region is a bucket, which resides on a <span class="keyword">Geode</span> node and contains all the entries that map to a single hashcode. In a typical partitioned region query, the system distributes the query to all buckets across all nodes, then merges the result sets and sends back the query results.

-   **[Query Debugging](../../developing/query_additional/query_debugging.html)**

    You can debug a specific query at the query level by adding the `<trace>` keyword before the query string that you want to debug.
