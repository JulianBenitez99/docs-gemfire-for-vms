title:  Exceptions and System Failures
---

Your application needs to catch certain classes to handle all the exceptions and system failures thrown by <span class="keyword">Pivotal GemFire</span>.

-   `GemFireCheckedException`. This class is the abstract superclass of exceptions that are thrown and declared. Wherever possible, GemFire exceptions are checked exceptions. `GemFireCheckedException` is a <span class="keyword">GemFire</span> version of `java.lang.Exception`.
-   `GemFireException`. This class is the abstract superclass of unchecked exceptions that are thrown to indicate conditions for which the developer should not normally need to check. You can look at the subclasses of `GemFireException` to see all the runtime exceptions in the GemFire system; see the class hierarchy in the online Java API documentation. `GemFireException` is a <span class="keyword">GemFire</span> version of java.lang.`RuntimeException`. You can also look at the method details in the `Region` API javadocs for <span class="keyword">GemFire</span> exceptions you may want to catch.
-   `SystemFailure`. In addition to exception management, <span class="keyword">GemFire</span> provides a class to help you manage catastrophic failure in your distributed system, particularly in your application. The Javadocs for this class provide extensive guidance for managing failures in your system and your application. See `SystemFailure` in the `com.gemstone.gemfire` package.

To see the exceptions thrown by a specific method, refer to the method's online Java documentation.

A <span class="keyword">GemFire</span> system member can also throw exceptions generated by third-party software such as JGroups or `java.lang` classes. For assistance in handling these exceptions, see the vendor documentation.
