title:  shutdown
---

Stop all members.

Asks all the members that have a cache to close the cache and disconnect from the system. If the `--include-locators` parameter is specified, the command shuts down any running locators one by one. The timeout parameter allows you to specify that the system should be shutdown forcibly after the time has exceeded.

**Availability:** Online. You must be connected in `gfsh` to a JMX Manager member to use this command.

**Syntax:**

``` pre
shutdown [--time-out=value] [--include-locators=value]
```
