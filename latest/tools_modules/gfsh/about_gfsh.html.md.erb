title:  What You Can Do with gfsh
---

`gfsh` supports the administration, debugging, and deployment of <span class="keyword">Apache Geode</span> processes and applications.

With `gfsh`, you can:

-   Start and stop <span class="keyword">Apache Geode</span> processes, such as locators and cache servers
-   Start and stop gateway sender and gateway receiver processes
-   Deploy applications
-   Create and destroy regions
-   Execute functions
-   Manage disk stores
-   Import and export data
-   Monitor <span class="keyword">Apache Geode</span> processes
-   Launch <span class="keyword">Apache Geode</span> monitoring tools

The `gfsh` command line interface lets developers spend less time configuring cache instance XML, properties, logs, and statistics. gfsh commands generate reports; capture cluster-wide statistics; and support the export of statistics, logs, and configurations. Like Spring Roo, gfsh features command completion (so you do not have to know the syntax), context-sensitive help, scripting, and the ability to invoke any commands from within an application by using a simple API. The gfsh interface uses JMX/RMI to communicate with <span class="keyword">Apache Geode</span> processes.

You can connect gfsh to a remote distributed system using the HTTP protocol. See [Using gfsh to Manage a Remote Cluster Over HTTP or HTTPS](../../configuring/cluster_config/gfsh_remote.html).

By default, the cluster configuration service saves the configuration of your <span class="keyword">Apache Geode</span> cluster as you create <span class="keyword">Apache Geode</span> objects using gfsh. You can export this configuration and import it into another <span class="keyword">Apache Geode</span> cluster. See [Overview of the Cluster Configuration Service](../../configuring/cluster_config/gfsh_persist.html#concept_r22_hyw_bl).
