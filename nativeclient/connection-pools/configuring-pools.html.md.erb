title:  Configuring Pools
---

A pool can be configured as locators or as a list of servers.

You configure locator, server, and pool settings declaratively in the client's `cache.xml` file or programmatically through the `PoolFactory` method. You create an instance of `PoolFactory` through `PoolManager`.
