title:  Accessing the QuickStart Guide
---

The QuickStart Guide for the native client consists of a set of compact programming samples that demonstrate both C++ and C\# client operations.

Open the QuickStart Guide to rapidly become familiar with native client functionality. To view the QuickStart Guide, navigate to the `SampleCode/quickstart` directory of your <span class="keyword">GemFire</span> native client installation, and open the `README.html` file.

The `README.html` file describes each programming sample, explains initial environment setup, and provides instructions for running the QuickStart examples.
