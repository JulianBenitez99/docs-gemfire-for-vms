title:  Encrypted Authentication
---

You can set up encrypted authentication using Diffe-Hellman or the sample PKCS implementation.

-   **[Encrypt Credentials with Diffe-Hellman](../../nativeclient/security/overviewencryptcred.html)**

    For secure transmission of sensitive credentials like passwords, encrypt credentials using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm. With Diffie-Hellman enabled, you can have your client authenticate its servers.

-   **[Using PKCS for Encrypted Authentication](../../nativeclient/security/PKCS.html)**

    This section discusses the concepts and configurations for the sample UserPassword and PKCS implementations. Descriptions of their interfaces, classes, and methods are available in the API.
