title:  Step 5. Start and stop the client and server
---

Before you start and stop the client and server, make sure you configure the native client with the SSL properties as described and with the servers or locators specified as usual.

Specifically, ensure that:

-   OpenSSL and ACE\_SSL `DLL`s locations are in the right environment variables for your system: `PATH` for Windows, and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for Unix.
-   You have generated the keys and keystores.
-   You have set the system properties.

For details on stopping and starting locators and cache servers with SSL, see [Starting Up and Shutting Down Your System](../../latest/configuring/running/starting_up_shutting_down.html).

**Example locator start command**

Ensure that all required SSL properties are configured in your server's `gfsecurity.properties` file. Then start your locator as follows:

``` pre
gfsh>start locator --name=my_locator --port=12345 --dir=. \
--security-properties-file=/path/to/your/gfsecurity.properties
```

**Example locator stop command**

``` pre
gfsh>stop locator --port=12345 \
--security-properties-file=/path/to/your/gfsecurity.properties
```

**Example server start command**

Again, ensure that all required SSL properties are configured in `gfsecurity.properties`. Then start the server with:

``` pre
gfsh>start server --name=my_server --locators=hostname[12345] \
--cache-xml-file=server.xml --log-level=fine \
--security-properties-file=/path/to/your/gfsecurity.properties
```

**Example server stop command**

``` pre
gfsh>stop server --name=my_server
```
