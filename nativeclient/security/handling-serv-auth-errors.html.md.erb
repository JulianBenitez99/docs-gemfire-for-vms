title:  Server Authentication Errors
---

An `AuthenticationRequiredException` is thrown when the server is configured with security and the client does not present its credentials while attempting to connect. This can occur if the `securityclient-auth-factory` and `security-client-auth-library` properties are not configured on the client.
