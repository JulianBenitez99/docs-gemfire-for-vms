title:  Client Authorization
---

Using a provided callback that implements the `AccessControl` interface, you can configure each server to authorize some or all cache operations.

The callback can also modify or even disallow the data being provided by the client in the operation, such as a put or a `putAll` operation. The callback can also register itself as a post-processing filter that is passed operation results like `get`, `getAll`, and `query`.

-   **[Configuring Client Authorization](../../nativeclient/security/config-clientauthorization.html)**

    You can configure authorization on a per-client basis for various cache operations such as create, get, put, query invalidations, interest registration, and region destroys. On the server side, the `securityclient-accessor` system property in the serverâ€™s `gemfire.properties` file specifies the authorization callback.

-   **[Post-Operative Authorization](../../nativeclient/security/postopauthorization.html)**

    Authorization in the post-operation phase occurs on the server after the operation is complete and before the results are sent to the client.

-   **[Determining Pre- or Post-Operation Authorization](../../nativeclient/security/usingoperationcontext.html)**

    The `OperationContext` object that is passed to the `authorizeOperation` method of the callback as the second argument provides an `isPostOperation` method that returns true when the callback is invoked in the post-operation phase.
