title:  Configuring Authentication by the Cache Server
---

When the cache server receives client credentials during the handshake operation, the server authenticates the client with the callback configured in the `security-client-authenticator` system property. The handshake succeeds or fails depending on the results of the authentication process.

Here is an example of how you could configure `security-client-authenticator` in the `gfcpp.properties` file:

`security-client-authenticator=templates.security.PKCSAuthenticator.create`

In the preceding configuration sample, `PKCSAuthenticator` is the callback class implementing the `Authenticator` interface and `create` is its factory method.

The following example shows an implementation of the static `create` method:

``` pre
public static Authenticator create() {
  return new PKCSAuthenticator();
}
```
