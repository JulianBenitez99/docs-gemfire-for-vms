title:  Determining Pre- or Post-Operation Authorization
---

The `OperationContext` object that is passed to the `authorizeOperation` method of the callback as the second argument provides an `isPostOperation` method that returns true when the callback is invoked in the post-operation phase.

For example:

``` pre
bool authorizeOperation(Region region, OperationContext context)
{
If(context.isPostOperation())
{
    //It's a post-operation
}
else
{
    //It's a pre-operation
}
}
```

If an authorization failure occurs in a pre-operation or post-operation callback on the server, the operation throws a `NotAuthorizedException` on the client.
