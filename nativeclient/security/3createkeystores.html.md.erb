title:  Step 2. Create keystores
---

The <span class="keyword">GemFire</span> server requires keys and keystores in the Java Key Store (JKS) format while the native client requires them in the clear PEM format. Thus you need to be able to generate private/public keypairs in either format and convert between the two using the `keytool` utility and the `openssl` command.

There are public third party free tools and source code available to download such as the "KeyTool IUI" tool.
