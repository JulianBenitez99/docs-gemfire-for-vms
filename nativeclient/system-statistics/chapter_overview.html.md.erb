title:  System Statistics
---

*System Statistics* provides information on the Pivotal GemFire installation and includes standard statistics for caching and distribution activities.

Statistics that end with "time" are time-based statistics. For performance reasons, by default, the system does not collect these. To enable time-based statistics gathering, set the system property` enable-time-statistics` in [Attributes in gfcpp.propertiesâ€”Statistics Archiving Properties](../setting-properties/attributes-gfcpp.html#attributes-gfcpp__table_E1A0EDBA67CD41319E1E5FD0A0BB2723).
