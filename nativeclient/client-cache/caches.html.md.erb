title:  Caches
---

The cache is the entry point to native client data caching in GemFire. Through the cache, native clients gain access to the GemFire caching framework for data loading, distribution, and maintenance.

-   **[About the Native Client Cache](../../../geode/nativeclient/client-cache/overview-client-cache.html)**

    The cache consists of data regions, each of which can contain any number of entries. Region entries hold the cached data. Every entry has a key that uniquely identifies it within the region and a value where the data object is stored.

-   **[Cache APIs](../../../geode/nativeclient/client-cache/caching-apis.html)**

    The native client has two cache APIs, `RegionService` and `Cache`.

-   **[Local, Remote, and Distributed Caches](../../../geode/nativeclient/client-cache/cache-ownership.html)**

    The *distributed system* defines how native client and cache server processes find each other.

-   **[Creating and Accessing a Cache](../../../geode/nativeclient/client-cache/create-access-cache.html)**

    When you create a native client cache, you are creating a native client cache instance. You must provide some basic configuration information such as a connection name and cache initialization parameters for the native client's cache instance.

-   **[Closing the Cache](../../../geode/nativeclient/client-cache/closing-cache.html)**

    Use the `Cache::close` function to release system resources when you finish using the cache.
