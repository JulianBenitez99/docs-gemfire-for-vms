title:  Caches

The cache is the entry point to native client data caching in <span class="keyword">GemFire</span>. Through the cache, native clients gain access to the <span class="keyword">GemFire</span> caching framework for data loading, distribution, and maintenance.

-   **[About the Native Client Cache](../../latest/nativeclient/client-cache/overview-client-cache.html)**

    The cache consists of data regions, each of which can contain any number of entries. Region entries hold the cached data. Every entry has a key that uniquely identifies it within the region and a value where the data object is stored.

-   **[Cache APIs](../../latest/nativeclient/client-cache/caching-apis.html)**

    The native client has two cache APIs, `RegionService` and `Cache`.

-   **[Local, Remote, and Distributed Caches](../../latest/nativeclient/client-cache/cache-ownership.html)**

    The *distributed system* defines how native client and cache server processes find each other.

-   **[Creating and Accessing a Cache](../../latest/nativeclient/client-cache/create-access-cache.html)**

    When you create a native client cache, you are creating a native client cache instance. You must provide some basic configuration information such as a connection name and cache initialization parameters for the native client's cache instance.

-   **[Closing the Cache](../../latest/nativeclient/client-cache/closing-cache.html)**

    Use the `Cache::close` function to release system resources when you finish using the cache.
