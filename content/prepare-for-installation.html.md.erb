title: Preparing for Installation
---

Work through these items prior to PCC tile installation.

- The [Networking for On-Demand Services](on-demand-networking.html)
section describes networking requirements for PCC.

- PCC requires TLS encryption for using gfsh and Pulse.
Follow the instructions in [Preparing for TLS](prepare-TLS.html) to
set up TLS encryption.

- [Optional] For systems that implement an authentication and enterprise SSO system
such as LDAP, follow the instructions within [Create a UAA Client](create-UAA-client.html).
There are also additional configuration steps to set up the SSO system,
as given within [Configuring UAA Roles](UAA-config.html).

- If you choose UAA as a security option, ensure that you have integrated the UAA
with one or more LDAP servers and have configured PAS with your LDAP endpoint information as
described in [Configure LDAP as an Identity provider for PAS](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/opsguide/auth-sso.html#configure-ldap).
