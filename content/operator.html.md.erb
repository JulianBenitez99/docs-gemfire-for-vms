title: Pivotal Cloud Cache Operator Guide
---


This document describes how a Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) operator can install, configure, and maintain Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC).

## <a id="requirements"></a> Requirements for Pivotal Cloud Cache

The [Networking for On-Demand Services](index.html#service-network)
section describes networking requirements for PCC.

## <a id="install"></a> Installing and Configuring Pivotal Cloud Cache

With an Ops Manager role (detailed in [Understand Roles in Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/config-rbac.html#about))
that has the proper permissions to install and configure,
follow these steps to install PCC on PCF:

1. Download the tile from the [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/cloud-cache).
1. Click **Import a Product** to import the tile into Ops Manager.
1. Click the **+** symbol next to the uploaded product description.
1. Click on the Cloud Cache tile.
1. Complete all the configuration steps in the [Configure Tile Properties](#settings-config) section below.
1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
Optionally, if you are using Ops Manager v2.3 or later, click **Review Pending Changes** (see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/review-pending-changes.html)).
1.  Click **Apply Changes** to complete the installation of the PCC tile.

### <a id="settings-config"></a> Configure Tile Properties

Configure the sections listed on the left side of the page.

![Tile Configuration Sections](tile-configuration-sections.png)

As you complete a section, save it.
A green check mark appears next to the section name.
Each section name must show this green check mark before you can complete your installation.

* [Assign AZs and Networks](#azs)
* [Settings](#settings)
* [Service Plans](#plan-config), including the Dev Plan
* [Syslog](#syslog)
* [Service Instance Upgrades](#parallel-upgrades)
* [Security](#security-section)
* [Errands](#errands)

####<a name='azs'></a> Assign Availability Zones and Networks

To select AZs and networks for VMs used by PCC, do the following:

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.

1. Configure the fields on the **Assign AZs and Networks** pane as follows:
   <table>
    <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Place singleton jobs in</strong></td>
        <td>Select the region that you want for singleton VMs.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Balance other jobs in</strong></td>
        <td>Select the AZ(s) you want to use for distributing other GemFire VMs.
            Pivotal recommends selecting all of them.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td>
        <td>Select your PAS (or Elastic Runtime) network.</td>
    <tr><td><strong>Service Network</strong></td>
        <td>Select the network to be used for GemFire VMs.</td>
  </table>

1. Click **Save**.

####<a name='settings'></a> Settings

####<a name='smoke-test-settings'></a> Smoke Test Settings

The smoke-tests errand that runs after tile installation.
The errand verifies that your installation was successful.
By default, the `smoke-test` errand runs on the `system` org and the `p-cloudcache-smoke-test` space.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Smoke tests will fail unless you enable global default application security groups (ASGs). You can enable global default ASGs by binding the ASG to the <code>system</code> org without specifying a space. To enable global default ASGs, use <code>cf bind-running-security-group</code>.</p>

To select which plan you want to use for smoke tests, do the following:

Select a plan to use when the `smoke-tests` errand runs.

Ensure the selected plan is enabled and configured.
For information about configuring plans, see [Configure Service Plans](#plan-config) below.
If the selected plan is not enabled, the `smoke-tests` errand fails.

Pivotal recommends that you use the smallest four-server plan for smoke tests.
Because smoke tests create and later destroy this plan, using a very small plan reduces installation time.
![Configuring Smoke Tests Plan](select-smoke-test-plan.png)

#### Settings: Allow Outbound Internet Access Settings

By default, outbound internet access is not allowed from service instances.

If BOSH is configured to use an external blob store, you need allow outbound internet access from service instances.
Log forwarding and backups, which require external endpoints, might also require internet access.

To allow outbound internet access from service instance, do the following:

Select **Allow outbound internet access from service instances (IaaS-dependent)**.

![Outbound Internet Access](allow-outbound-access.png)

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Outbound network traffic rules also depend on your IaaS settings.
Consult your network or IaaS administrator to ensure that your IaaS allows outbound traffic to the external networks you need.</p>

#### Default Distributed System ID Setting

Every service instance has an integer identifier called a distributed system ID.
The ID defaults to the value 0.
Service instances that form a distributed system that communicates
across a WAN will need distinct IDs.
Those distinct ID values are set when creating the service instance.

To change the default distributed system ID value,
replace the default value of 0 with your new default value.
Acceptable values are integers greater than or equal to 0 and
less than or equal to 255.

![Default Distributed System ID setting](dist-sys-ID-default.png)

<a name="plan-config"></a>
#### Configure Service Plans

You can configure five individual plans for your developers. Select the **Plan 1** through **Plan 5** tabs to configure each of them.

![Configuring a Plan](configure-plan.png)

The **Plan Enabled** option is selected by default. If you do not want to add this plan to the CF service catalog, select **Plan Disabled**. You must enable at least one plan.

The **Plan Name** text field allows you to customize the name of the plan. This plan name is displayed to developers when they view the service in the Marketplace.

The **Plan Description** text field allows you to supply a plan description. The description is displayed to developers when they view the service in the Marketplace.

The **Enable metrics for service instances** checkbox enables metrics for service instances created using the plan.
Once enabled, the metrics are sent to the Loggregator Firehose.

The **CF Service Access** drop-down menu gives you the option to display or not display the service plan in the Marketplace.
**Enable Service Access** displays the service plan the Marketplace.
**Disable Service Access** makes the plan unavailable in the Marketplace. If you choose this option, you cannot make the plan available at a later time.
**Leave Service Access Unchanged** makes the plan unavailable in the Marketplace by default, but allows you to make it available at a later time.

The **Service Instance Quota** sets the maximum number of PCC clusters that can exist simultaneously.

When developers create or update a service instance, they can specify the number of servers in the cluster. The **Maximum servers per cluster** field allows operators to set an upper bound on the number of servers developers can request. If developers do not explicitly specify the number of servers in a service instance, a new cluster has the number of servers specified in the **Default Number of Servers** field.

The **Availability zones for service instances** setting determines which AZs are used for a particular cluster. The members of a cluster are distributed evenly across AZs.

<p class="note warning"><strong> WARNING!</strong> After you've selected AZs for your service network, you cannot add additional AZs; doing so causes existing service instances to lose data on update. </p>

The remaining fields control the VM type and persistent disk type for servers and locators. The total size of the cache is directly related to the number of servers and the amount of memory of the selected server VM type. We recommend the following configuration:

* For the **VM type for the Locator VMs** field, select a VM that has at least 2 CPUs, 1&nbsp;GB of RAM and 4&nbsp;GB of disk space.
* For the **Persistent disk type for the Locator VMs** field, select 10&nbsp;GB or higher.
* For the **VM type for the Server VMs** field, select a VM that has at least 2 CPUs, 4&nbsp;GB of RAM and 8&nbsp;GB of disk space.
* For the **Persistent disk type for the server VMs** field, select 10 GB or higher.

When you finish configuring the plan, click **Save** to save your configuration options.

####<a id='dev-plan'></a> Configure a Dev Plan

A Dev Plan is a type of service plan.
Use a Dev Plan for development and testing.
The plan provides a single locator and server,
which are colocated within a single VM.

The page for configuring a Dev Plan is similar to the page for configuring
other service plans.
To configure the Dev Plan, input information in the fields and make selections from the options on the **Plan for test development** page.

![Dev Plan Configuration Sections](dev-plan.png)

If you have enabled post-deploy scripts in your BOSH Director,
a region is automatically created.
To confirm that post-deploy scripts are enabled, navigate to the **Director Config** pane of Ops Manger Director and
verify that **Enable Post Deploy Scripts** is selected.

![Enable post deploy scripts](ops-man-post-deploy.png)

####<a name='syslog'></a> Syslog

By default, syslog forwarding is not enabled in PCC.
However, PCC supports forwarding syslog to an external log management service (for example, Papertrail, Splunk, or your custom enterprise log sink).
The broker logs are useful for debugging problems creating, updating, and binding service instances.

To enable remote syslog for the service broker, do the following:

1. Click **Syslog**.
   ![Configuring Log Management Service](syslog-config.png)
2. Configure the fields on the **Syslog** pane as follows:
   <table>
    <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Enable Remote Syslog</strong></td>
        <td>Select to enable.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong></strong>External Syslog Address</td>
        <td>Enter the address or host of the syslog server for sending logs, for example, `logs.example.com`.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong></strong>External Syslog Port</td>
        <td>Enter the port of the syslog server for sending logs, for example,` 29279`.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Enable TLS for Syslog</strong></td>
    <td>Select to enable secure log transmission through TLS. Without this, remote syslog sends unencrypted logs. We recommend enabling TLS, as most syslog endpoints such as Papertrail and Logsearch require TLS.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Permitted Peer for TLS Communication. This is required if TLS is enabled.</strong></td>
        <td>If there are several peer servers that can respond to remote syslog connections, then
            provide a regex, such as `*.example.com`.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>CA Certificate for TLS Communication</td>
        <td>If the server certificate is not signed by a known authority, for example, an internal syslog server,
            provide the CA certificate of the log management service endpoint.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Send service instance logs to external</td>
        <td>By default, only the broker logs are forwarded to your configured log management service.
            If you want to forward server and locator logs from all service instances, select this.
            This lets you monitor the health of the clusters, although it generates a large volume of logs.<br><br>
            If you don't enable this, you get only the broker logs which include information about service instance creation,
            but not about on-going cluster health.</td></tr>
  </table>

3. Click **Save**.

####<a name='parallel-upgrades'></a>Service Instance Upgrades

A configurable number of service instances may be upgraded
concurrently by entering a new
value that is greater than one and less than the BOSH worker count
for the **Number of simultaneous upgrades**.

Specify a set of service instances to act as canaries for the
upgrade process by changing the **Number of upgrade canary instances**
to a value greater than 0.
If all canary instances successfully upgrade,
the remaining instances are upgraded.
If any canary instance fails to upgrade, the upgrade fails
and no further instances are upgraded.

Click **Save** after changing values.

![Instance Upgrades section](instance-upgrades-section.png)

####<a name='security-section'></a> Security

The environment may be configured to more securely store service keys
within CredHub,
instead of within the cloud controller's data store.
To enable this functionality:

1. Click **Security**.

2. Click on the box labeled **Enable Secure Service Instance Credentials**
to enable use of CredHub.

3. An 'X' is required in the text box to promote the understanding that
a TLS-enabled service instance cannot be created if the PCF environment
is not set up to handle TLS. See [Preparing for TLS](#preparing-for-TLS) for how to prepare the PCF environment.

3. Click **Save**.

![Security section](security-configuration-section.png)

####<a name='errands'></a> Errands

By default, post-deploy and pre-delete errands always run.
Pivotal recommends keeping these defaults.
However, if necessary, you can change these defaults as follows.

For general information about errands in PCF, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/managing_errands.html)

1. Click **Errands**.

2. Change the setting for the errands.

3. Click **Save**.

## <a id="set_quotas"></a> Setting Service Instance Quotas

-----------

On-demand provisioning is intended to accelerate app development by eliminating the need for development teams to request
and wait for operators to create a service instance.
However, to control costs, operations teams and administrators must ensure responsible use of resources.

There are several ways to control the provisioning of on-demand service instances by setting various **quotas** at these levels:

* [Global](#global)
* [Plan](#plan)
* [Org](#org) 
* [Space](#space)

After you set quotas, you can:

* [View Current Org and Space-level Quotas](#view)
* [Monitor Quota Use and Service Instance Count](#monitor)
* [Calculate Resource Costs for On-Demand Plans](#calculate)


## <a id="global"></a> Create Global-level Quotas

Each Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) service has a separate service broker.
A global quota at the service level sets the maximum number of service instances that can be created by a given service broker. If a service has more than one plan, then the number of service instances for all plans combined cannot exceed the global quota for the service.

The operator sets a global quota for each PCF service independently.
For example, if you have Redis for PCF and RabbitMQ for PCF, you must set a separate global service quota for each of them. 

When the global quota is reached for a service, no more instances of that service can be created unless the quota is increased, or some instances of that service are deleted.

The global quota is set in the service tile in Ops Manager, shown for an example service below.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This is an example image only. 
	The following screen may look slightly different for your service or release version.</p>

![service_level_quotas](images/service_level_quota.png)


## <a id="plan"></a> Create Plan-level Quotas

A service may offer one or more plans.
You can set a separate quota per plan so that instances of that plan cannot exceed the plan quota.
For a service with multiple plans, the total number of instances created for all plans combined cannot exceed the [global quota](#global) for the service. 

When the plan quota is reached, no more instances of that plan can be created unless the plan quota is increased or some instances of that plan are deleted.

The plan quota is set in the service tile in Ops Manager, shown for an example service plan below.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This is an example image only. 
	The following screen may look slightly different for your service or release version.</p>

![plan_level_quotas](images/plan_level_quota.png)

## <a id="org"></a> Create and Set Org-level Quotas

An org-level quota applies to all PCF services and sets the maximum number of service instances an organization can create within PCF.
For example, if you set your org-level quota to 100, developers can create up to 100 service instances in that org using any combination of PCF services. 

When this quota is met, no more service instances of any kind can be created in the org unless the quota is increased or some service instances are deleted.

To create and set an org-level quota, do the following:

1. Run this command to create a quota for service instances at the org level:

	<pre>
	cf create-quota QUOTA-NAME -m TOTAL-MEMORY -i INSTANCE-MEMORY -r ROUTES -s SERVICE-INSTANCES --allow-paid-service-plans
	</pre>

	where these variables are:

	<br>`QUOTA-NAME`---A name for this quota
	<br>`TOTAL-MEMORY`---Maximum memory used by all service instances combined
	<br>`INSTANCE-MEMORY`---Maximum memory used by any single service instance
	<br>`ROUTES`---Maximum number of routes allowed for all service instances combined
	<br>`SERVICE-INSTANCES`---Maximum number of service instances allowed for the org

	<br> For example: 
	<br>`cf create-quota myquota -m 1024mb -i 16gb -r 30 -s 50 --allow-paid-service-plans`

2. Associate the quota you created above with a specific org by running the following command:

	<pre>
	cf set-quota ORG-NAME QUOTA-NAME
	</pre>

	For example: `cf set-quota dev_org myquota`

For more information on managing org-level quotas,
see [Creating and Modifying Quota Plans](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-12/adminguide/quota-plans.html).

## <a id="space"></a> Create and Set Space-level Quotas

A space-level service quota applies to all PCF services and sets the maximum number of service instances
that can be created within a given space in PCF.
For example, if you set your space-level quota to 100,
developers can create up to 100 service instances in that space using any combination of PCF services. 

When this quota is met, no more service instances of any kind can be created in the space unless the quota is updated
or some service instances are deleted.

To create and set a space-level quota, do the following:

1. Run the following command to create the quota:

	<pre>
	cf create-space-quota QUOTA -m TOTAL-MEMORY -i INSTANCE-MEMORY -r ROUTES -s SERVICE-INSTANCES --allow-paid-service-plans
	</pre>
	where these variables are:

	<br>`QUOTA-NAME`---A name for this quota
	<br>`TOTAL-MEMORY`---Maximum memory used by all service instances combined
	<br>`INSTANCE-MEMORY`---Maximum memory used by any single service instance
	<br>`ROUTES`---Maximum number of routes allowed for all service instances combined
	<br>`SERVICE-INSTANCES`---Maximum number of service instances allowed for the org

	<br> For example: `cf create-space-quota myspacequota -m 1024mb -i 16gb -r 30 -s 50 --allow-paid-service-plans`


2. Associate the quota you created above with a specific space by running the following command:

	<pre>
	cf set-space-quota SPACE-NAME QUOTA-NAME
	</pre>

	For example: 
	<br>`cf set-space-quota myspace myspacequota`

For more information on managing space-level quotas,
see [Creating and Modifying Quota Plans](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-12/adminguide/quota-plans.html).

## <a id="view"></a> View Current Org and Space-level Quotas

To view **org** quotas, run the following command. 

```
cf org ORG-NAME
```

To view **space** quotas, run the following command: 

```
cf space SPACE-NAME
```

For more information on managing org and space-level quotas,
see the [Creating and Modifying Quota Plans](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-12/adminguide/quota-plans.html).

## <a id="monitor"></a> Monitor Quota Use and Service Instance Count

Service-level and plan-level quota use, and total number of service instances,
are available through the on-demand broker metrics emitted to Loggregator.
These metrics are listed below:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th><b>Metric Name</b></th>
		<th><b>Description</b></th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>on-demand-broker/SERVICE-NAME/quota_remaining </td>
		<td>Quota remaining for all instances across all plans</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>on-demand-broker/SERVICE-NAME/PLAN-NAME/quota_remaining </td>
		<td>Quota remaining for a specific plan</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>on-demand-broker/SERVICE-NAME/total_instances</td>
		<td>Total instances created across all plans</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>on-demand-broker/SERVICE-NAME/PLAN-NAME/total_instances</td>
		<td>Total instances created for a specific plan</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Quota metrics are not emitted if no quota has been set.</p>


## <a id="calculate"></a> Calculate Resource Costs for On-Demand Plans

On-demand plans use dedicated VMs, disks, and various other resources from an IaaS, such as AWS.
To calculate maximum resource cost for plans individually or combined,
you multiply the quota by the cost of VM and Persistent Disk types selected in the plan configuration(s).
The specific costs depend on your IaaS. 

The image below shows an example of the VM type and persistent disk selected, as well as the quota for this plan.

![plan resources](http://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/img/plan-resources.png) 

<p class="note"><strong>Important</strong>:
	Although operators can limit on-demand instances with plan quotas and a global quota, as described in the above topics,
        IaaS resource usage still varies based on the number of on-demand instances provisioned.</p>

### Calculate Maximum Resource Cost Per On-Demand Plan 

To calculate the maximum cost of VMs and persistent disk for each plan, do the following calculation:


**plan quota x cost of selected resources**


For example, if you selected the options in the above image,
you have selected a VM type **micro.cpu** and a persistent disk type **20&nbsp;GB**, and the plan quota is **15**.
The VM and persistent disk types have an associated cost for the IaaS you are using.
Therefore, to calculate the maximum cost of resources for this plan, multiply the cost of the resources selected by the plan quota:

**(15 x cost of micro.cpu VM type) + (15 x cost of 20&nbsp;GB persistent disk)**

### Calculate Maximum Resource Cost for All On-Demand Plans

To calculate the maximum cost for all plans combined, add together the maximum costs for each plan.
This assumes that the sum of your individual plan quotas is less than the global quota.

Here is an example:

**(plan1 quota x plan1 resource cost) + ( plan2 quota x plan2 resource cost) = max cost for all plans**


### Calculate Actual Resource Cost of all On-Demand Plans

To calculate the current actual resource cost across all your on-demand plans:

1. Find the number of instances currently provisioned for each active plan by looking at the `total_instance` [metric](#monitor) for that plan.

2. Multiply the `total_instance` count for each plan by that plan's resource costs.
   Record the costs for each plan.

3. Add up the costs noted in Step 2 to get your total current resource costs.

For example:

**(plan1 total\_instances x plan1 resource cost) + (plan2 total\_instances x plan2 resource cost) = current cost for all plans**

##<a id='preparing-for-TLS'></a> Preparing for TLS

This topic describes how to provide an existing Certificate Authority (CA)
certificate to [BOSH CredHub](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/credhub.html) and how to generate a new CA
certificate with BOSH CredHub, if you do not already have one.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Before creating a new TLS-enabled PCC instance, you must perform the procedures in this topic. The procedures will change your PCF deployment.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: This procedure involves restarting all of the VMs in your PCF deployment in order to propagate a CA certificate. The operation can take a long time to complete.</p>

###<a id='overview'></a> Overview

Enabling TLS provisions new PCC service instances with a certificate so that apps can establish an encrypted connection with the data service.

The certificate deployed on the PCC service instance is a
**server certificate**.
The server certificate is generated by **CredHub**, a component designed for centralized credential management in PCF.
**CredHub** is deployed on the same VM as the BOSH Director.

CredHub generates the server certificate using a **Certificate Authority (CA) certificate**.
The CA certificate must be provided to CredHub by the operator or generated by CredHub.

Apps use the CA certificate to authenticate components of PCC
service instances.
Apps that communicate with PCC must have access to the CA certificate
in order to validate that the server certificate can be trusted.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: An operator must rotate the CA certificate if it expires or if it becomes compromised.
To rotate your CA certificate, see
<a href="https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/360002542194-Rotating-CA-Certificates-for-Pivotal-Cloud-Foundry-Services">Rotating CA Certificates for Pivotal Cloud Foundry Services</a>
in the Pivotal Knowledge Base.
Do not attempt to rotate a CA certificate on your own.
Contact <a href="https://support.pivotal.io">Pivotal Support</a>
and perform the procedure in the Pivotal Knowledge Base article with their assistance.</p>

###<a id="provide-generate-pcf"></a> Provide or Generate a CA Certificate

Perform the following procedures to create a
User Account and Authentication (UAA) client for CredHub,
log in to CredHub, and provide or generate a CA certificate.

####<a id='uaa'></a> Create a UAA Client

Perform the following steps to create a UAA client for CredHub on your UAA server:

1. Retrieve the IP address of the BOSH Director VM and the Director credentials by performing the steps
   in [Gather Credential and IP Address Information](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#gather).<br><br>
   Both the UAA and CredHub servers are colocated on the BOSH Director VM.

1. SSH into the Ops Manager VM by performing the steps in [SSH into Ops Manager VM](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh).

1. From the Ops Manager VM, use the UAA Command Line Interface (UAAC) to target the UAA server on the BOSH Director VM.
    In the UAAC command, specify the IP address for the BOSH Director VM and port 8443.
    <br><br>
    Run the following command:

    ```
    uaac target BOSH-DIRECTOR:8443
    ```
    <br>
    where `BOSH-DIRECTOR` is the IP address of the BOSH Director VM.
    You retrieved this address from the **Status** tab of the Ops Manager Director tile in step 1.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ uaac target 10.0.0.5:8443
    </pre>

1. In the **Credentials** tab of the Ops Manager Director tile, retrieve the **UAA Login Client Credentials** and record the `identity` and `password` values.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: These are the credentials for the UAA server colocated on the BOSH Director, not the UAA server colocated on Pivotal Application Service.</p>

1. Retrieve the **UAA Admin User Credentials** and record the `identity` and `password` values.

1. From the Ops Manager VM, use the UAAC to get a token.
    <br><br>
    Run the following command:

    ```
    uaac token owner get login --secret=UAA-LOGIN-CLIENT-CRED
    ```
    <br>
    where `UAA-LOGIN-CLIENT-CRED` is the `password` value of the **UAA Login Client Credentials** that you retrieved in step 4.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ uaac token owner get \
        login --secret=abcdefghijklm123456789
    </pre>

1. When prompted for a user name and password, enter the values for `identity` and `password` of the **UAA Admin User Credentials**
   that you retrieved in step 5.
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    User name:  admin
    Password:  ********************************
    </pre>

1. Add a UAA client for CredHub with the correct grants.
    <br><br>
    Enter the following command:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ uaac client add \
    	--authorized_grant_types client_credentials \
    	--authorities credhub.read,credhub.write
    </pre>

1. When prompted for Client ID, enter `credhub`.
   When prompted for `New client secret`, enter a secure password of your choice.
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    Client ID:  credhub
    New client secret:  *******
    Verify new client secret:  *******
      scope: uaa.none
      client\_id: credhub
      resource\_ids: none
      authorized\_grant\_types: client\_credentials
      autoapprove:
      authorities: credhub.write credhub.read
      name: credhub
      required_user_groups:
      lastmodified: 1518198701452
      id: credhub
      created_by: f609e861-39ec-4a16-8aee-cba9e9b079e3
    </pre>

####<a id='add-ca-cert'></a> Add the CA Certificate

Perform the following steps to log in to CredHub, provide or generate a CA certificate, and add the certificate to Ops Manager:

1. From the Ops Manager VM, set the API target of the CredHub CLI to your CredHub server.
    <br><br>
    Run the following command:

    ```
    credhub api https://BOSH-DIRECTOR:8844 --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    ```
    <br>
    where `BOSH-DIRECTOR` is the IP address of the BOSH Director VM.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ credhub api http<span>s:</span>//10.0.0.5:8844 --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    </pre>

1. Log in to CredHub.
    <br><br>
    Run the following command:

    ```
    credhub login --client-name=credhub --client-secret=CLIENT-SECRET
    ```
    <br>
    where `CLIENT-SECRET` is the client secret you set in step 9 above.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ credhub login \
    	--client-name=credhub \
    	--client-secret=abcdefghijklm123456789
    </pre>

1. Use the CredHub CLI to check whether a services CA certificate already is present.
    <br><br>
	* Enter the following command:
  	<pre class="terminal">
  	$ credhub get \
  		  --name="/services/tls_ca"
  	</pre>
  * If you already have a certificate at the `services/tls_ca` path, skip to step 5.

1. Use the CredHub CLI to generate a CA certificate or provide an existing one.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Your PCF deployment may have multiple CA certificates.
       Pivotal recommends a dedicated CA certificate for services.</p>
	* If you do not have a CA certificate, use the CredHub CLI to generate one.
          Enter the following command:
		<pre class="terminal">
		$ credhub generate \
			--name="/services/tls_ca" \
			--type="certificate" \
			--no-overwrite \
			--is-ca \
            --common-name="rootCA"
		</pre>
    * If you have an existing CA certificate that you want to use, create a new file called `root.pem` with the contents of the certificate.
      Then enter the following command, specifying the path to `root.pem` and the private key for the certificate:
        <pre class="terminal">
        $ credhub set \
            --name="/services/tls_ca" \
            --type="certificate" \
            --certificate=./root.pem \
            --private=ERKSOSMFF...
        </pre>

1. Use the BOSH CLI v2 to extract the `certificate` portion from the CA certificate and print it.
    Enter the following command:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh2 interpolate <(credhub get --name=/services/tls_ca) \
    --path /value/certificate
    </pre>
1. Record the output of the `bosh2 interpolate` command from step 4.
1. Navigate to the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard** and select the Ops Manager Director tile.
Click **Security**.
1. Paste the contents of the CA certificate into **Trusted Certificates** and click **Save**.
1. The CA certificate must also be added for the Gorouter.
Navigate to the PAS **Settings** tab.
Click on **Networking**.
Add the CA certificate to the box labeled **Certificate Authorities Trusted by Router and HAProxy** and click **Save**.
1.  Optionally, if you are using Ops Manager v2.3 or later, click **Review Pending Changes** (see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/review-pending-changes.html)).
1.  Click **Apply Changes**.

## <a id="monitoring"></a> Monitoring Pivotal Cloud Cache Service Instances

PCC clusters and brokers emit service metrics.
You can use any tool that has a corresponding Cloud Foundry nozzle to read and monitor these metrics in real time.

In the descriptions of the metrics,
KPI stands for Key Performance Indicator.

### <a id="bosh-errand-report"></a> Total Memory Consumption

The BOSH `mem-check` errand calculates and outputs
the quantity of memory used across all PCC service instances.
This errand helps PCF operators monitor resource costs,
which are based on memory usage.

From the director, run a BOSH command of the form:

``` pre
bosh -d <service broker name> run-errand mem-check
```

With this command:

``` pre
bosh -d cloudcache-service-broker run-errand mem-check
```

Here is an anonymized portion of example output from the `mem-check` errand
for a two cluster deployment:

``` pre
           Analyzing deployment xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx1...
           JVM heap usage for service instance xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx1
           Used Total = 1204 MB
           Max Total = 3201 MB

           Analyzing deployment xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx2...
           JVM heap usage for service instance xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx2
           Used Total = 986 MB
           Max Total = 3201 MB

           JVM heap usage for all clusters everywhere:
           Used Global Total = 2390 MB
           Max Global Total = 6402 MB
```

### <a id="monitoring-prometheus"></a> Monitoring PCC Service Instances with Prometheus

Prometheus is one of various tools you can use to monitor services instances. It is a monitoring and alerting toolkit that allows for metric scraping.
You can use the [Firehose exporter](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/firehose_exporter) to export all the metrics from the Firehose,
which you can then graph with [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) to monitor your PCC cluster.

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/prometheus-on-PCF) to deploy Prometheus alongside your PCF cluster.

Prometheus can be deployed on any IaaS.
You need to verify that the Firehose exporter job can talk to your UAA VM.
This might involve opening up firewall rules or enabling your VM to allow outgoing traffic.

## <a id="upgrade"></a> Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Cache

Upgrade minor release versions from your currently deployed version
to the target version in sequential order.
For example, PCC v1.2 must be upgraded to PCC v1.3 prior to
upgrading to PCC v1.4.
Note that each PCC release is compatible with two
Pivotal Application Service (PAS) and Ops Manager versions,
as specified in the [Product Snapshot](index.html#snapshot).
Incorporate those upgrades to PAS and Ops Manager in your upgrade process
as required to maintain compatibility,
as described in
[Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html).

Follow the steps below to upgrade PCC:

1. Download the new version of the tile from the Pivotal Network.
1. Upload the product to Ops Manager.
1. Click **Add** next to the uploaded product.
1. Click on the Cloud Cache tile and configure the upgrade options.
    - To try the upgrade on a small number of service instances first, set the quantity of canary service instances as described in [Service Instance Upgrades](operator.html#parallel-upgrades).
    - Set the number of instances that are to be upgraded in parallel as described in [Service Instance Upgrades](operator.html#parallel-upgrades).
    - Make sure that under the **Errands** section, the **Upgrade All
    Service Instances Post-Deploy Errand** is Default (On).
    **Save** the change.

1.  Optionally, if you are using Ops Manager v2.3 or later, click **Review Pending Changes** (see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/review-pending-changes.html)).
1.  Click **Apply Changes**.

## <a id="migrate-to-TLS"></a> Migrating to a TLS-Enabled Cluster

An existing PCC service instance that does not use TLS encryption
may be migrated to become a PCC service instance with TLS encryption enabled.
<p class="note warning"><strong> WARNING!</strong> This procedure will require downtime for the service instance
during the migration. </p>
Follow the procedure given here _after_ these prerequisites have
been met:

- All steps within [Preparing for TLS](#preparing-for-TLS)
have been completed.
- The service instance has been upgraded to PCC v1.5.2
or a more recent PCC version. There will be no PCC version change during
the migration.

Follow this procedure to migrate the existing PCC service instance:

<ol>
<li> As a PCF operator, stop all apps.
First, list all apps to identify the <code>APP_NAME</code>.

<pre>
$ cf apps
</pre>

    Then, stop each app with:

<pre>
$ cf stop APP_NAME
</pre>
</li>

<li> For all non-persistent regions, use the <code>gfsh</code> command line tool
to export the data.
<i>Without an export, all non-persistent region entries will be irretrievably lost.</i>
    <ul>
    <li> Complete the steps within
    [Accessing a Service Instance](accessing-instance.html#gfsh-connect-https)
    to acquire the correct version of <code>gfsh</code>, run it,
    and connect to the cluster using the cluster operator role/credentials from the service key.
    </li>
    <li> List the regions.

        <pre>
gfsh>list regions </pre>
    </li>
    <li> For each region, use <code>gfsh describe</code> to determine if the region
    is persistent or not and to acquire a server name.

        <pre>
gfsh>describe region --name=REGION_NAME </pre>
    </li>
    <li> For each non-persistent region, use this single <code>gfsh</code> command
    to export all the data within the region.
    The <code>SERVER_NAME</code> identifies which GemFire server receives the
    <code>export</code> command and propagates the command to all other GemFire
    servers within the cluster.

        <pre>
gfsh>export data --parallel --region=REGION_NAME --member=SERVER_NAME --dir=/var/vcap/store/gemfire-server </pre>
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li> Your PCF operator needs to target the BOSH Director
in order to acquire the <code>DEPLOYMENT_NAME</code>.
    <ul>
    <li> Run

        <pre>
$ cf service SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME </pre>
    to acquire the digits that uniquely identify the service instance.
    The digits (<code>XXX-XXX</code> in the following instructions) are those
    between <code>cloudcache-</code> and the period <code>.</code>.
    <li> Log in to the BOSH Director.

        <pre>
$ bosh log-in </pre>
    </li>
    <li> The <code>DEPLOYMENT_NAME</code> will appear in the output of

        <pre>
$ bosh deployments | grep XXX-XXX </pre>
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li> Using PCF operator credentials, stop the BOSH director:

    <pre>
$ bosh -d DEPLOYMENT_NAME stop </pre>
    and type "y" when prompted.
</li>
<li> Acquire the BOSH manifest with:

    <pre>
$ bosh -d DEPLOYMENT_NAME manifest > DEPLOYMENT_NAME-manifest.yml </pre>
</li>

<li> Edit the acquired BOSH manifest.
There are three locations within the manifest
file that will require additions.
These three locations are identified within this anonymized portion of the
manifest file with the symbols <font color=red> &#9312 </font>,
<font color=red> &#9313 </font>, and <font color=red> &#9314 </font>.
The first part of the manifest file is omitted,
as its listed values change based on the PCC version.
Real passwords have been replaced with the placeholder <code>password</code>,
and user names have been replaced with the placeholder <code>userX</code>
within this example.

## <a id="update-plans"></a> Updating Pivotal Cloud Cache Plans

Follow the steps below to update plans in Ops Manager.

1. Click on the Cloud Cache tile.
1. Click on the plan you want to update under the **Information** section.
1. Edit the fields with the changes you want to make to the plan.
1. Click **Save** button on the bottom of the page.
1. Click on the **PCF Ops Manager** to navigate to the **Installation Dashboard**.
1.  Optionally, if you are using Ops Manager v2.3 or later, click **Review Pending Changes** (see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/review-pending-changes.html)).
1.  Click **Apply Changes**.

Plan changes are not applied to existing services instances until you run the `upgrade-all-service-instances` BOSH errand. You must use the BOSH CLI to run this errand. Until you run this errand, developers cannot update service instances.

Changes to fields that can be overridden by optional parameters, for example  `num_servers` or `new_size_percentage`, change the default value of these instance properties, but do not affect existing service instances.

If you change the allowed limits of an optional parameter, for example the maximum number of servers per cluster, existing service instances in violation of the new limits are not modified.

When existing instances are upgraded, all plan changes are applied to them.
Upgrades and updates to service instances can cause a rolling restart
of GemFire servers.
Be aware that the rebalancing of data to maintain redundancy
may impact the performance of the remainder of
the servers within the service instance.

<p class="note warning"><strong> WARNING:</strong> Data loss may result
from the restart of a cluster. See
<a href="./update-instance.html#cluster-restart">Restarting a Cluster</a>
for the conditions under which data loss occurs.</p>

## <a id="uninstall"></a> Uninstalling Pivotal Cloud Cache

To uninstall PCC, follow the steps from below from the **Installation Dashboard**:

1. Click the trash can icon in the bottom-right-hand corner of the tile.
1.  Optionally, if you are using Ops Manager v2.3 or later, click **Review Pending Changes** (see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/review-pending-changes.html)).
1.  Click **Apply Changes**.

## <a id="troubleshooting"></a> Troubleshooting

###<a id='view-statistics'></a> View Statistics Files

You can visualize the performance of your cluster by downloading the statistics files from your servers.
These files are located in the persistent store on each VM.
To copy these files to your workstation, run the following command:

    `bosh2 -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME scp server/0:/var/vcap/store/gemfire-server/statistics.gfs /tmp`

See the Pivotal GemFire [Installing and Running VSD](http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/gemfire/tools_modules/vsd/running_vsd.html) topic for information about loading the statistics files into Pivotal GemFire VSD.

###<a id='smoke-test-failures'></a> Smoke Test Failures

#### Error: "Creating p-cloudcache SERVICE-NAME failed"
The smoke tests could not create an instance of GemFire. To troubleshoot
why the deployment failed, use the cf CLI to create a new service instance using the same plan and download the logs of the service deployment from BOSH.

#### Error: "Deleting SERVICE-NAME failed"
The smoke test attempted to clean up a service instance it created and failed to delete the service using the `cf delete-service` command. To troubleshoot this issue, run BOSH `logs` to view the logs on the broker or the service instance to see why the deletion may have failed.

#### Error: Cannot connect to the cluster SERVICE-NAME
The smoke test was unable to connect to the cluster.

To troubleshoot the issue, review the logs of your load balancer, and
review the logs of your CF Router to ensure the route to your PCC
cluster is properly registered.

You also can create a service instance and try to connect to it using the
gfsh CLI. This requires creating a service key.

#### Error: "Could not perform create/put on Cloud Cache cluster"
The smoke test was unable to write data to the cluster. The user may not have
permissions to create a region or write data.

#### Error: "Could not retrieve value from Cloud Cache cluster"
The smoke test was unable to read back the data it wrote. Data loss can happen
if a cluster member improperly stops and starts again or if the member machine
crashes and is resurrected by BOSH. Run BOSH `logs` to view the logs on the
broker to see if there were any interruptions to the cluster by a service
update.

###<a id='general-connectivity'></a> General Connectivity
#### Client-to-Server Communication

PCC Clients communicate to PCC servers on port 40404 and with
locators on port 55221.
Both of these ports must be reachable from the PAS (or Elastic Runtime) network to service the network.

#### Membership Port Range
PCC servers and locators communicate with each other using UDP and TCP. The current port range for this communication is `49152-65535`.

If you have a firewall between VMs, ensure this port range is open.
