Select the "Caching Plan" tabs to configure the service plans that will be available to developers. 5 caching plans are expected to be configured by default.

First you must check the "Enable Service Plan" checkbox if you would like the caching plan to be available in the CF marketplace. Note that the smoke test errand will fail if you do not check this or disable the errand.

The "Plan Description" text field allows you to enter a plan description that will be displayed to developers.

The "Service Instance Quota" configures the maximum number of Cloud Cache clusters that can exist simultaneously.

When a developer creates (or updates) a service instance they will have the option to specify the number of servers in the cluster. The "Maximum servers per cluster" field allows the operator to set an upper bound on the number of servers a developer can request. If the developer does not explicitly specify the number of servers in a service instance the new cluster will have the number of servers specified in the "Default Number of Servers" field.

The "Availability zones for service instances" setting controls which availability zones the members of a cluster are evenly distributed across.

The remaining fields control the vm type and persistent disk type for servers and locators. The total size of the cache is directly related to the number of servers and the amount of memory of the selected server vm type.

When you are done configuring the plan be sure to click "Save" to save your configuration options.

### Viewing statistics files

The gemfire statistics files are located in the persistent store on each vm: `/var/vcap/store/gemfire-server/statistics.gfs`.

To `scp` the statistics files to your workstation, you can run the following command:

```
bosh scp server/0:/var/vcap/store/gemfire-server/statistics.gfs /tmp
```

Visit [this link](http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/gemfire/tools_modules/vsd/running_vsd.html) for instructions on loading the statistics files into Pivotal GemFire VSD.
