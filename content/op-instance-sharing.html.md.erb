title: Enable Service-Instance Sharing
---

The Cloud Cache implementation of instance sharing permits
read-only access to a Cloud Cache service instance within one space
by an app within another space.
A Cloud Foundry `admin` operator,
or one with administrative privileges,
may enable service-instance sharing for Cloud Cache service instances.

Enable service-instance sharing across a foundation with:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf enable-feature-flag service_instance_sharing
</pre>

A developer will need to set up Cloud Cache service-instance sharing
as detailed in [Service-Instance Sharing](dev-instance-sharing.html).
