title: Developing an App Under TLS
---

Apps that connect to a TLS-enabled PCC service instance
require a truststore containing the certificate from where the
PAS environment TLS termination occurs,
and they must set properties to configure the communication with
the Pivotal GemFire components within the PCC service instance.

Follow this procedure to set up the truststore:

1. Acquire the certificate you use to configure TLS termination.
See [Determine Your TLS Termination](accessing-instance.html#tls-termination).
2. Add the certificate to an existing truststore or create a new
truststore in the app's `src/main/resources` folder.
See [Create a Truststore](accessing-instance.html#truststore) for
instructions.
The location for this truststore is fixed.
If the app uses a truststore located in a different spot than
the `src/main/resources` folder,
create a new truststore in this required location.

Four GemFire properties must be set to configure communication:

1. Set `ssl-enabled-components` to `all`.
1. Set `ssl-truststore` to the absolute path and file name of the
truststore as it will exist within the expanded JAR file of the deployed app.
1. Set `ssl-truststore-password` to the password chosen when
the truststore was created.
1. Set `ssl-require-authentication` to `false`, such that there will
be one-way authentication of the GemFire component to the app.

For a Spring Data GemFire app that places its truststore in
`src/main/resources`, these properties map to

```
spring.data.gemfire.security.ssl.truststore=/home/vcap/app/BOOT-INF/classes/truststore.jks
spring.data.gemfire.security.ssl.truststore.password=TRUSTSTORE-PASSWORD
spring.data.gemfire.security.ssl.require.authentication=false
```

where `TRUSTSTORE-PASSWORD` is the password chosen during truststore
creation.

For other apps, the GemFire properties should be

```
ssl-enabled-components=all
ssl-truststore=/home/vcap/app/BOOT-INF/classes/truststore.jks
ssl-truststore-password=TRUSTSTORE-PASSWORD
ssl-require-authentication=false
```

where `TRUSTSTORE-PASSWORD` is the password chosen during truststore
creation.

The build and `cf push` of the app does not require any changes
to work with a TLS-enabled PCC service instance.
