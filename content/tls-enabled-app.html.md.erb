title: Developing an App Under TLS
---

Apps that connect to a TLS-enabled PCC service instance
require a truststore containing the certificate from where the
PAS environment TLS termination occurs.

Follow this brief procedure to set up the truststore:

1. Acquire the certificate you use to configure TLS termination.
See [Determine Your TLS Termination](accessing-instance.html#tls-termination).
2. Add the certificate to an existing truststore or create a new
truststore in the app's `src/main/resources` folder.
See [Create a Truststore](accessing-instance.html#truststore) for
instructions.
The location for this truststore is fixed.
If the app uses a truststore located in a different spot than
the `src/main/resources` folder,
create a new truststore in this required location.
3. The build and `cf push` of the app does not require any changes
to work with a TLS-enabled PCC service instance.
