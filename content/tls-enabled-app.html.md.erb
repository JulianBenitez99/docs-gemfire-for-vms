title: Developing an App Under TLS
---

Apps that connect to a TLS-enabled PCC service instance
must set properties to configure the communication with
the Pivotal GemFire components within the PCC service instance.

Ensure that the cluster-level prerequisite step of
[Preparing for TLS](prepare-TLS.html) has been completed.

For the app,
setting the GemFire property `ssl-require-authentication` to `false`
causes one-way authentication of the GemFire component to the app.

For a Spring Data GemFire app,
attach the `@EnableSsl` annotation to your configuration class
to enable the TLS encryption for all GemFire components.
Also set these GemFire properties:

```
ssl-use-default-context=true
ssl-endpoint-identification-enabled=false
spring.data.gemfire.security.ssl.require.authentication=false
```

For other apps, the GemFire properties should be

```
ssl-enabled-components=all
ssl-require-authentication=false
ssl-use-default-context=true
ssl-endpoint-identification-enabled=false
```

An app may set these properties with the `ClientCacheFactory.set()` method,
prior to creating a `ClientCache` instance.

The build and `cf push` of the app does not require any changes
to work with a TLS-enabled PCC service instance.
