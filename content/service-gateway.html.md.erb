title: Using a Service Gateway
---

The service gateway allows apps that run in a different location than
the Services Foundation where the <%=vars.product_short%> service instance runs
to communicate with the service instance.
At its core, the service gateway is a TCP router.

There are three locations where an app may run.
The locations are defined in
[The App's Location](architecture.html#AppLocation).

Apps that run within an App Foundation and apps that run completely outside of
any foundation must have a service gateway enabled and running
to communicate with the <%=vars.product_short%> service instance.
To enable and run the service instance:

- The operator must
[Configure a Service Gateway](configure-service-gateway.html).
- The developer must [Provide Optional Parameters](create-instance.html#params)
when creating the <%=vars.product_short%> service instance.
- The app must be given and use properties that authenticate
and authorize [Communicating with a Service Instance](running-app.html#app-location) through the service gateway.
