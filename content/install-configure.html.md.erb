## <a id="settings-config"></a> Configure Tile Properties

Configure the sections listed on the left side of the page. 

![Tile Configuration Sections](./images/tile-configuration-sections.png)

As you complete a section, save it.
A green check mark appears next to the section name.
Each section name must show this green check mark before you can complete your installation.

* [Assign AZs and Networks](#azs)
* [Settings](#settings)
* All [Service Plans](#plan-config)
* [Syslog](#syslog)
* [Service Instance Upgrades](#parallel-upgrades)
* [Security](#security-section)
* [Errands](#errands)

### <a id='azs'></a> Assign Availability Zones and Networks

To select AZs and networks for VMs used by <%=vars.product_short%>, do the following:

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.

1. Configure the fields on the **Assign AZs and Networks** pane as follows:
   <table>
    <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Place singleton jobs in</strong></td>
        <td>Select the region that you want for singleton VMs.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Balance other jobs in</strong></td>
        <td>Select the AZ(s) you want to use for distributing other cluster VMs.
            VMware recommends selecting all of them.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td>
        <td>Select your PAS (or Elastic Runtime) network.</td>
    <tr><td><strong>Service Network</strong></td>
        <td>Select the network to be used for cluster VMs.</td> 
  </table>

1. Click **Save**.

### <a id='settings'></a> Settings

#### <a id='smoke-test-settings' class="no-quick-link"></a> Settings: Smoke Test Plan

The smoke-tests errand that runs after tile installation.
The errand verifies that your installation was successful.
By default, the `smoke-test` errand runs on the `system` org and the `p-cloudcache-smoke-test` space.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Smoke tests will fail unless you enable global default application security groups (ASGs). You can enable global default ASGs by binding the ASG to the <code>system</code> org without specifying a space. To enable global default ASGs, use <code>cf bind-running-security-group</code>.</p>

To select which plan you want to use for smoke tests, do the following:

Select a plan to use when the `smoke-tests` errand runs.

Ensure the selected plan is enabled and configured.
For information about configuring plans, see [Configure Service Plans](#plan-config) below.
If the selected plan is not enabled, the `smoke-tests` errand fails.

VMware recommends that you use the smallest four-server plan for smoke tests.
Because smoke tests create and later destroy this plan, using a very small plan reduces installation time.

![Configuring Smoke Tests Plan](./images/select-smoke-test-plan.png)

#### Settings: Allow Outbound Internet Access Settings

By default, outbound internet access is not allowed from service instances. 

If BOSH is configured to use an external blob store, you need allow outbound internet access from service instances.
Log forwarding and backups, which require external endpoints, might also require internet access.

To allow outbound internet access from service instance, do the following:

Select **Allow outbound internet access from service instances (IaaS-dependent)**.

![Outbound Internet Access](./images/allow-outbound-access.png)

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Outbound network traffic rules also depend on your IaaS settings. 
Consult your network or IaaS administrator to ensure that your IaaS allows outbound traffic to the external networks you need.</p>

#### Settings: Default Distributed System ID

Every service instance has an integer identifier called a distributed system ID.
The ID defaults to the value 0.
Service instances that form a distributed system that communicates
across a WAN will need distinct IDs.
Those distinct ID values are set when creating the service instance.

To change the default distributed system ID value,
replace the default value of 0 with your new default value.
Acceptable values are integers greater than or equal to 0 and
less than or equal to 255.

![Default Distributed System ID setting](./images/dist-sys-ID-default.png)

#### Settings: Shareable Instances

To enable [service-instance sharing](dev-instance-sharing.html) for this <%=vars.product_short%>
service instance, set Shareable Instances to Yes.

![Configure shareable instances](./images/configure-shareable-instances.png)


### <a id="settings-sg"></a> Settings: Enable Creation of a Service Gateway

The service gateway permits apps running outside the services foundation
(TAS) to communicate with the <%=vars.product_short%> service instance.
See [The App's Location](architecture.html#AppLocation) for an
introduction to the service gateway.

If the communication between apps and the 
<%=vars.product_short%> service instance require a service gateway,
choose the 'Yes' radio button in the **Enable Service Gateway** setting.
This will permit the instantiation of the service gateway when
a service instance is created and specifies a service gateway.

Enter a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for the
**FQDN for TCP Router** field.
This was the FQDN used when enabling TCP routing.
The FQDN may also be found in the output of the `cf domains` command.
From the output, choose the `name` field  with type `tcp`.

Set the **Ingress Port for TCP Router** field with an unused port
that was noted when TCP routing was enabled.
Alternatively, to find the range of ports from which to choose,
from **Ops Manager**, click **Tanzu Application Service**,
and then choose **Networking**.
The range of ports from which to choose is near the bottom of the page
in a field named **TCP routing ports** under the heading of **TCP routing**.

Click **Save**.

![Enable Service Gateway setting](./images/enable-svc-gateway.png)

To complete enabling the creation of a service gateway,
within the <%=vars.product_short%> tile settings,
click on **Resource Config**.
Enter a value of at least 1 for the **TCP Router** **INSTANCES** field.

Click **SAVE**.

![Set TCP Router instances setting](./images/TCPRouter-instances.png)

### <a id="plan-config"></a> Configure Service Plans

You will configure 11 individual plans by selecting each of the tabs.
There are **Plan 1** through **Plan 5**,
three plans that reside on a single VM (called **Co-located Single VM Plan**),
and three plans that spread locators and servers among three VMs
(called **Co-located Multi VM Plan**).

![Configuring a Plan](./images/configure-plan.png)

The **Plan Enabled** option is selected by default. If you do not want to add this plan to the CF service catalog, select **Plan Disabled**. You must enable at least one plan.

The **Plan Name** text field allows you to customize the name of the plan. This plan name is displayed to developers when they view the service in the Marketplace.

The **Plan Description** text field allows you to supply a plan description. The description is displayed to developers when they view the service in the Marketplace.

The **Enable metrics for service instances** checkbox enables metrics for service instances created using the plan.
Once enabled, the metrics are sent to the Loggregator Firehose.

The **CF Service Access** drop-down menu gives you the option to display or not display the service plan in the Marketplace.
**Enable Service Access** displays the service plan the Marketplace.
**Disable Service Access** makes the plan unavailable in the Marketplace. If you choose this option, you cannot make the plan available at a later time. 
**Leave Service Access Unchanged** makes the plan unavailable in the Marketplace by default, but allows you to make it available at a later time.

The **Maximum service instances** field sets the maximum number of <%=vars.product_short%> clusters that can exist simultaneously.

When developers create or update a service instance, they can specify the number of servers in the cluster. The **Maximum servers per cluster** field allows operators to set an upper bound on the number of servers developers can request. If developers do not explicitly specify the number of servers in a service instance, a new cluster has the number of servers specified in the **Default Number of Servers** field.

The **Availability zones for service instances** setting determines which AZs are used for a particular cluster. The members of a cluster are distributed evenly across AZs.

<p class="note warning"><strong> WARNING!</strong> After you've selected AZs for your service network, you cannot add additional AZs; doing so causes existing service instances to lose data on update. </p>

The remaining fields control the VM type and persistent disk type for servers and locators. The total size of the cache is directly related to the number of servers and the amount of memory of the selected server VM type. We recommend the following configuration:

* For the **VM type for the Locator VMs** field, select a VM that has at least 2 CPUs, 1&nbsp;GB of RAM and 4&nbsp;GB of disk space.
* For the **Persistent disk type for the Locator VMs** field, select 10&nbsp;GB or higher.
* For the **VM type for the Server VMs** field, select a VM that has at least 2 CPUs, 4&nbsp;GB of RAM and 8&nbsp;GB of disk space.
* For the **Persistent disk type for the server VMs** field, select 10 GB or higher.

For more information on how VM memory is allocated, see [VM Memory Allocation](memory-allocation.html).

When you finish configuring the plan, click **Save** to save your configuration options.

#### <a id='small-footprint-plan'></a> Configure a Co-located Multi VM Plan

Any of the Co-located Multi VM Plans use three VMs to implement a default
plan with three locators and three servers.
Each of the three VMs has one locator and one server.
**Co-located Multi VM Plan 1** has a default plan name of `small-footprint`. 

This type of plan is appropriate for production installations that can tolerate the
diminished load-handling capacity and reduced resilience that would
result from the loss of a VM.
Installations needing resilience in the face of a VM loss
should use a plan in which each <%=vars.product_short%> cluster member resides within
its own VM.

A <%=vars.product_short%> service instance using a Co-located Multi VM Plan may be created
with more servers than the default three servers.
Follow the instructions within
[Creating a <%=vars.product_full%> Service Instance](create-instance.html)
to increase the number of servers.

Scale up an existing service instance by increasing the number of servers,
as specified in 
[Updating a <%=vars.product_full%> Service Instance](update-instance.html).

Whether creating a new service instance or updating an existing service
instance to have more servers,
each additional server will be within its own VM.

Scaling down the quantity of servers within an existing service instance
is accomplished one server at a time to ensure redundancy is 
correctly maintained.
To scale down, use the `cf update-service` command as described in
[Updating a <%=vars.product_full%> Service Instance](update-instance.html)
to specify one server fewer than the total quantity of servers currently
running.

An error message will be issued if an attempt is made to scale down
by more than one server at a time,
or if an attempt is made to reduce the number of servers below the
minimum size of the default Co-located Multi VM Plan size of three servers.

To configure a Co-located Multi VM Plan,
enable the plan with the Co-located Multi VM Plan tab.

![Configuring a Co-located Multi VM Plan](./images/configure-sf-plan.png)

#### <a id='dev-plan'></a> Configure a Co-located Single VM Plan

A Co-located Single VM Plan is a type of service plan.
The plan provides a single locator and server,
which are colocated within a single VM. 

<p class="note warning"><strong> WARNING:</strong> Data loss results when the single VM this plan provides goes down or restarts.</p>

The plan automatically creates a single region called
`example_partition_region`.
The region type is `PARTITION`, a partitioned region without
redundancy or persistence of entries.
You can create other regions as desired with a Co-located Single VM Plan service instance.

There are three Co-located Single VM Plans to configure.
The page for configuring this plan is similar to the page for configuring 
other service plans.
To configure a Co-located Single VM Plan, input information in the fields and make selections from the options on each **Configure Co-located Single VM Plan** page. 

![Co-located Single VM Plan Configuration Sections](./images/dev-plan.png)

### <a id='syslog'></a> Syslog

By default, syslog forwarding is not enabled in <%=vars.product_short%>.
However, <%=vars.product_short%> supports forwarding syslog to an external log management service (for example, Papertrail, Splunk, or your custom enterprise log sink).
The broker logs are useful for debugging problems creating, updating, and binding service instances.

To enable remote syslog for the service broker, do the following:

1. Click **Syslog**.
   ![Configuring Log Management Service](./images/syslog-config.png)
2. Configure the fields on the **Syslog** pane as follows:
   <table>
    <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Do you want to configure Syslog for VMware GemFire?</strong></td>
        <td>Select `Yes` to enable.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Address</strong></td>
        <td>Enter the address or host of the syslog server for sending logs, for example, `logs.example.com`.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Port</strong></td>
        <td>Enter the port of the syslog server for sending logs, for example,` 29279`.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Transport Protocol</strong></td>
    <td>Choose `TCP`, `UDP`, or `RELP`.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Send service instance logs to external</td>
        <td>By default, only the broker logs are forwarded to your configured log management service.
            If you want to forward server and locator logs from all service instances, select this.
            This lets you monitor the health of the clusters, although it generates a large volume of logs.<br><br>
            If you don't enable this, you get only the broker logs which include information about service instance creation, 
            but not about on-going cluster health.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Enable TLS</strong></td>
    <td>Select to enable secure log transmission through TLS. Without this, remote syslog sends unencrypted logs. We recommend enabling TLS, as most syslog endpoints such as Papertrail and Logsearch require TLS.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Permitted Peer</strong></td>
        <td>This is required if TLS is enabled. If there are several peer servers that can respond to remote syslog connections, then
            provide a regex, such as `*.example.com`.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>SSL Certificate</td>
        <td>Specifies the CA certificate for TLS communication. If the server certificate is not signed by a known authority, for example, an internal syslog server,
            provide the CA certificate of the log management service endpoint.</td></tr>
  </table>

3. Click **Save**.

### <a id='parallel-upgrades'></a>Service Instance Upgrades

A configurable number of service instances may be upgraded 
concurrently by entering a new
value that is greater than one and less than the BOSH worker count
for the **Number of simultaneous upgrades**.

Specify a set of service instances to act as canaries for the
upgrade process by changing the **Number of upgrade canary instances**
to a value greater than 0.
If all canary instances successfully upgrade,
the remaining instances are upgraded.
If any canary instance fails to upgrade, the upgrade fails
and no further instances are upgraded.

Click **Save** after changing values.

![Instance Upgrades section](./images/instance-upgrades-section.png)

### <a id='security-section'></a> Security

There are three configuration aspects to the Security settings.
Each of the three must be considered and appropriately handled
within these settings.
Once the Security properties settings have been set,
click **Save**.
The Security properties Settings page appears as:

![Security section](./images/security-settings.png)

The three items in this page to handle are:

1.  The environment may be configured to more securely store service keys
within CredHub,
instead of within the cloud controller's data store.
To enable this functionality,
click on the box labeled **Enable Secure Service Instance Credentials**
to enable use of CredHub.
When service keys are stored within CredHub,
output from the `cf env APP-NAME` command will not show credentials.

2. An 'X' is required in the text box to promote the understanding that
the environment must be set up to handle TLS encryption.
See [Preparing for Transport Layer Security (TLS)](prepare-TLS.html) for how to
prepare the <%=vars.app_runtime_abbr%> environment.

3. If User Account and Authentication (UAA) of <%=vars.product_short%> users will go
through an external system,
enable that with the radio button labeled **UAA Auth enabled**.
With UAA enabled, create a UAA client before doing this tile installation
as explained in [Create a UAA Client](create-UAA-client.html).
Also follow the instructions in
[Configuring UAA Roles](UAA-config.html) to complete the
configuration by setting up the user roles.
With UAA enabled, two text boxes will appear.
Fill the boxes with the UAA client name and that
client's secret, which were set when the client was created.

### <a id='errands'></a> Errands

By default, post-deploy and pre-delete errands always run. 
VMware recommends keeping these defaults.
However, if necessary, you can change these defaults as follows.

For general information about errands in <%=vars.app_runtime_abbr%>, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/managing_errands.html)

1. Click **Errands**.

2. Change the setting for the errands.

3. Click **Save**.
