title: Set Up WAN-Separated Service Instances
---

Two service instances may form a single distributed system across a WAN.
The interaction of the two service instances may follow one of 
the patterns described within the section on
[Design Patterns](design-patterns.html).

Call the two service instances A and B.
The GemFire cluster within each service instance uses an identifier
called a `distributed_system_id`.
This example assigns `distributed_system_id = 1` to Cluster A
and `distributed_system_id = 2` to Cluster B.
GemFire gateway senders provide the communication path and construct that
propagates region operations from one cluster to another.
On the receiving end are GemFire gateway receivers. 
Creating a service instance also creates gateway receivers.
