This topic describes how to provide an existing Certificate Authority (CA)
certificate to [BOSH CredHub](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-10/credhub.html) and how to generate a new CA
certificate with BOSH CredHub, if you do not already have one.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: This procedure involves restarting all of the VMs in an existing <%=vars.app_runtime_full%> (<%=vars.app_runtime_abbr%>) deployment in order to propagate a CA certificate. The operation can take a long time to complete.</p>

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

Enabling TLS provisions <%=vars.product_full%> service instances with a certificate,
so that apps, gfsh, and Pulse can establish encrypted connections
with the <%=vars.product_short%> service instance.

The certificate deployed on the <%=vars.product_short%> service instance is a
**server certificate**.
The server certificate is generated by **CredHub**, a component designed for centralized credential management in <%=vars.app_runtime_abbr%>.
CredHub is deployed on the same VM as the BOSH Director.

CredHub generates the server certificate using a **Certificate Authority (CA) certificate**.
The CA certificate must be provided to CredHub by the operator or generated by CredHub.

Apps use the CA certificate to authenticate components of <%=vars.product_short%> service instances.
Apps that communicate with <%=vars.product_short%> must have access to the CA certificate
in order to validate that the server certificate can be trusted.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: An operator must rotate the CA certificate if it expires or if it becomes compromised.
To rotate your CA certificate, see <a href="rotating-ca.html">Managing Certificates</a>.
Do not attempt to rotate a CA certificate on your own.
Contact <%=vars.support_link%> and perform the procedure with their assistance.</p>

## <a id="provide-generate-pcf"></a> Provide or Generate a CA Certificate

TLS authorization requires a credential generated by CredHub. You do not need to create a new User
Account and Authentication (UAA) client for CredHub specifically to support TLS, as long as a UAA
Client exists with `credhub.write` and `credhub.read` permissions. The client used in this section is one that
was created during the <%=vars.ops_manager%> installation process: the `ops_manager` client. 

Perform the following steps to log in to CredHub and provide or generate a CA certificate:

1. From the <%=vars.ops_manager%> VM, set the API target of the CredHub CLI to your CredHub server:

    ```
    credhub api https://BOSH-DIRECTOR:8844 --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    ```
    Where `BOSH-DIRECTOR` is the IP address of the BOSH Director VM.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ credhub api http<span>s:</span>//10.0.0.5:8844 --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    </pre>

1. Log in to CredHub:

    ```
    credhub login --client-name=CLIENT-NAME --client-secret=CLIENT-SECRET
    ```
    Where:
    * `CLIENT-NAME` is the client name, usually `ops_manager` or a CredHub-specific UAA client of your own creation.
    * `CLIENT-SECRET` is the client secret. Locate this under the Credentials tab of the <%=vars.ops_manager%> tile with the name `Bosh Commandline Credentials`.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ credhub login \
        --client-name=ops_manager \
        --client-secret=abcdefghijklm123456789
    </pre>

1. Use the CredHub CLI to check whether a services CA certificate already is present:

    ```
    credhub get --name="/services/tls_ca"
    ```
    If you already have a certificate at the `services/tls_ca` path, skip to step 5.

1. Use the CredHub CLI to generate a CA certificate or provide an existing one.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Your deployment may have multiple CA certificates.
    VMware recommends that you use a dedicated CA certificate for services.</p>

    * If you do not have a CA certificate, use the CredHub CLI to generate one:

        ```
        credhub generate \
        --name="/services/tls_ca" \
        --type="certificate" \
        --no-overwrite \
        --is-ca \
        --common-name="rootCA"
        ```

    * If you have an existing CA certificate that you want to use, create a new file named `root.pem` with the contents of the certificate. Then enter the following command, specifying the path to `root.pem` and the private key for the certificate:

        ```
        credhub set \
        --name="/services/tls_ca" \
        --type="certificate" \
        --certificate=./root.pem \
        --private=ERKSOSMFF...
        ```

1. Use the BOSH CLI v2 to extract the `certificate` portion from the CA certificate and print it:

    ```
    bosh2 interpolate <(credhub get --name=/services/tls_ca) \
    --path=/value/certificate
    ```

1. Record the output of the `bosh2 interpolate` command.

## <a id='add-ca-cert-bosh'></a> Add the CA Certificate to <%=vars.ops_manager%>

Add the CA certificate to <%=vars.ops_manager%> by adding it to the BOSH Director tile and the Tanzu Application Service tile.

### Add the CA certificate to the BOSH Director tile:

1. Navigate to the <%=vars.ops_manager%> **Installation Dashboard** and select the **Ops Manager Director** tile.
Click **Security**.

1. Copy and paste the contents of the CA certificate into **Trusted Certificates**.
If Trusted Certificates are already listed, append the new certificate to the existing content.

1. Click **Save**.

### Add the CA certificate to the Tanzu Application Service tile

1. The CA certificate must also be added for the Gorouter.
Navigate to the TAS tile's **Settings** tab.

1. Click on **Networking**. Add the CA certificate to the box labeled **Certificate Authorities Trusted by Gorouter**.<br />
  ![Networking: CA Gorouter](./images/tas-networking-ca-gorouter.png)

1. Scroll down and add the CA certificate to the box labeled **Certificate Authorities trusted by the HAProxy**.<br />
  ![Networking: CA HA Proxy](./images/tas-networking-ca-haproxy.png)

1. Click **Save**.
