- See [Design Patterns](./design-patterns.html)
for descriptions of the variety of design patterns that Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC) supports.
- PCC stores objects in key/value format, where "value" can be any object.
- See [gfsh Command Restrictions](using-pcc.html#gfsh-restrictions) for limitations on the use of gfsh commands.

## Limitations

- PCC does not support scaling down of the cluster.
- PCC does not support plan migrationsâ€”for example, `-p` flag with the `cf update-service` command.
