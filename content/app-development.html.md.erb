title: Application Development
---

An app that interacts with a PCC service instance will
use the Pivotal GemFire&reg; cluster within that service instance.
Architecting the data storage for the app requires some familiarity
with GemFire.

This section introduces design patterns for structuring app design.
It presents a minimal view of GemFire data organization to help
with data architecture design.
A complete presentation of GemFire's capabilities is in the
[Pivotal GemFire Documentation](http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/gemfire/about_gemfire.html).
