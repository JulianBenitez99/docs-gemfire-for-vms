title: Configuring UAA Roles
---

Extra configuration is required when defining users that have specific
security roles with an
authentication and enterprise single sign-on (SSO) such as LDAP.

##<a id='UAA Roles'></a> The Roles

A PCC service instance internally defines four security roles.
Each role is given predefined permissions for cluster operations.
Each user is assigned security roles.
As that user invokes a PCC cluster operation using gfsh,
the PCC service's security manager verifies that the permission
required for the cluster operation is one that the user's security
role has.

The permissions assigned for each of the security roles:

- **ADMIN** has all permissions needed to manage the cluster and
can access region data.
This role has the GemFire permissions
`CLUSTER:MANAGE`,
`CLUSTER:WRITE`,
`CLUSTER:READ`,
`DATA:MANAGE`,
`DATA:WRITE`,
and `DATA:READ`.
- **OPERATOR** has all permissions needed to manage the cluster.
This role may not handle or see region data.
This role has the GemFire permissions
`CLUSTER:MANAGE`,
`CLUSTER:WRITE`,
and `CLUSTER:READ`.
- **DATA-ACCESS** has all permissions needed to handle and see region data.
This role has the GemFire permissions
`CLUSTER:READ`,
`DATA:WRITE`,
and `DATA:READ`.
- **READ-ONLY** has the single GemFire permission `DATA:READ`
to see region data.

##<a id='UAA-Config-Roles'></a> Configuring the Roles

Configure the UAA server and your Enterprise SSO system
(such as LDAP) with the space-specific roles.

1. Acquire the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) for the CF space
that will host your PCC service instance:

    ```
    $ cf login -a REST-OF-ARGS-HERE
    $ cf target -o NAME-OF-ORG
    $ cf space --guid NAME-OF-SPACE
    ```

    The form of the output GUID will be similar to the example:

    ````
    03badc2a-4243-4251-84b5-c9bfba276f04
    ````

2. Create space-specific groups for each role within
your Enterprise SSO system.
The group name will take the form `ROLE_GUID`. 
For example, in the following group name:

    ````
    ADMIN_03badc2a-4243-4251-84b5-c9bfba276f04
    ````
    `ADMIN` is the role, and `03badc2a-4243-4251-84b5-c9bfba276f04` is
    the GUID.

3. Place users into the created space-specific groups you created
within your Enterprise SSO system.

4. Use the UAA Command Line Interface (UUAC) to log in as `admin client`
to your UAA server.

5.  Use the UUAC to add each group name with:

    ```
    $ uaac group add ROLE_GUID
    ```

5.  Use the UUAC to map each group name with `uuac group map`
commands. The commands are described in 
[Grant Admin Permissions to an External Group (SAML or LDAP)](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/uaa/uaa-user-management.html#external-group).
For LDAP:

    ```
    $ uaac group map --name ROLE_GUID "GROUP-DISTINGUISHED-NAME"
    ```
    where `GROUP-DISTINGUISHED-NAME` is the distinguished name of
    each space-specific group created in step 2.
