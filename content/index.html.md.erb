## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC) is a high-performance, high-availability caching layer for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). 
PCC offers an in-memory key-value store. It delivers low-latency responses to a large number of concurrent data access requests.

PCC provides a service broker to create in-memory data clusters on demand. 
These clusters are dedicated to the PCF space and tuned for specific use cases defined by your service plan. 
Service operators can create multiple plans to support different use cases.

PCC uses Pivotal GemFire. You can use PCC to store any kind of data objects using the [Pivotal GemFire Java client library](http://gemfire-90-javadocs.docs.pivotal.io/).

This documentation performs the following functions:

* Describes the features and architecture of PCC
* Provides the PCF operator with instructions for installing, configuring, and maintaining PCC
* Provides app developers instructions for choosing a service plan, creating, and deleting PCC service instances
* Provides app developers instructions for binding apps

### <a id='GFBasics'></a>GemFire Basics

Pivotal GemFire is the data store within Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC). A small amount of administrative GemFire setup is required for a PCC service instance, and any app will use a limited portion of the GemFire API.

The PCC architectural model is a client-server model. The clients are apps or microservices, and the servers are a set of GemFire servers maintained by a PCC service instance. The GemFire servers provide a low-latency, consistent, fault-tolerant data store within PCC.

![Client Server Model](client-server.png)

GemFire holds data in key/value pairs. Each pair is called an **entry**. Entries are logically grouped into sets called regions. A region is a map (or dictionary) data structure.

The app (client) uses PCC as a cache. A cache lookup (read) is a get operation on a GemFire region. The cache operation of a cache write is a put operation on a GemFire region.
The GemFire command-line interface, called `gfsh`, facilitates region administration. Use `gfsh` to create and destroy regions within the PCC service instance.

### <a id='pcc-cluster-architecture'></a>The PCC Cluster

PCC deploys cache clusters that use Pivotal GemFire to provide high availability, replication guarantees, and eventual consistency.

When you first spin up a cluster, you have three locators and at least four servers.

<% mermaid_diagram do %>
  graph TD;
  Client
  subgraph P-CloudCache Cluster
  subgraph locators
  Locator1
  Locator2
  Locator3
  end
  subgraph servers
  Server1
  Server2
  Server3
  Server4
  end
  end
  Client==>Locator1
  Client-->Server1
  Client-->Server2
  Client-->Server3
  Client-->Server4
<% end %>

When you scale the cluster up, you have more servers, increasing the capacity of the cache. There are always three locators.

<% mermaid_diagram do %>
  graph TD;
  Client
  subgraph P-CloudCache Cluster
  subgraph locators
  Locator1
  Locator2
  Locator3
  end
  subgraph servers
  Server1
  Server2
  Server3
  Server4
  Server5
  Server6
  Server7
  end
  end
  Client==>Locator1
  Client-->Server1
  Client-->Server2
  Client-->Server3
  Client-->Server4
  Client-->Server5
  Client-->Server6
  Client-->Server7
<% end %>

### <a id='MemberCommunication'></a>Member Communication

When a client connects to the cluster, it first connects to a locator. The locator replies with the IP address of a server for it to talk to. The client then connects to that server.

<% mermaid_diagram do %>
  sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Locator
    participant Server1
    Client->>+Locator: What servers can I talk to?
    Locator->>-Client: Server1
    Client->>Server1: Hello!
<% end %>

When the client wants to read or write data, it sends a request directly to the server.

<% mermaid_diagram do %>
  sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server1
    Client->>+Server1: What's the value for KEY?
    Server1->>-Client: VALUE
<% end %>

If the server doesn't have the data locally, it fetches it from another server.

<% mermaid_diagram do %>
  sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server1
    participant Server2
    Client->>+Server1: What's the value for KEY?
    Server1->>+Server2: What's the value for KEY?
    Server2->>-Server1: VALUE
    Server1->>-Client: VALUE
<% end %>

## <a id="service-network"></a>Networking for On-Demand Services

This section describes networking considerations for Pivotal Cloud Cache.

### <a id="bosh2"></a>BOSH 2.0 and the Service Network

<%= partial '../../p-cloud-cache/odb/service_networks' %>

### <a id ="architecture_networks"></a>Default Network and Service Network

Like other on-demand PCF services, PCC relies on the BOSH 2.0 ability to dynamically deploy VMs in a dedicated network. The on-demand service broker uses this capability to create single-tenant service instances in a dedicated service network.

<%= partial '../../p-cloud-cache/odb/on_demand_architecture' %>

The diagram below shows worker VMs in an on-demand service instance, such as RabbitMQ for PCF, running on a separate services network, while other components run on the default network.

<%= partial '../../p-cloud-cache/odb/service_networks_table' %>

### <a id ="WAN_details"></a>PCC Instances Across WAN

PCC service instances running within distinct PCF foundations
may communicate with each other across a WAN.
In a topology such as this,
the members within one service instance use their own private address space,
as defined in [RFC1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918).

A VPN may be used to connect the private network spaces that lay
across the WAN.
The steps required to enable the connectivity by VPN are dependent
on the IaaS provider(s).

The private address space for each service instance's network
must be configured with non-overlapping CIDR blocks.
Configure the network prior to creating service instances.
Locate directions for creating a network on the appropriate IAAS provider
within the section titled
[Architecture and Installation Overview](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/installing/index.html).

## <a id='recommended-usage'></a>Recommended Usage and Limitations

- PCC supports the [look-aside cache pattern](./app-development.html#lookaside-cache).
- PCC stores objects in key/value format, where value can be any object.
- Any gfsh command not explained in the PCC documentation is **not supported**.
- PCC supports basic OQL queries, with no support for joins.

### Limitations

- Scale down of the cluster is not supported.
- Plan migrations, for example, `-p` flag with the `cf update-service` command, are not supported.
- WAN (Cross Data Center) replication is not supported.

## <a id='security'></a>Security

Pivotal recommends that you do the following:

- Run PCC in its own network
- Use a load balancer to block direct, outside access to the Gorouter

To allow PCC network access from apps, you must create application security groups that allow access on the following ports:

* 1099
* 8080
* 40404
* 55221

For more information, see the PCF [Application Security Groups](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html#creating-groups) topic.

PCC works with the IPsec Add-on for PCF.
For information about the IPsec Add-on for PCF,
see [Securing Data in Transit with the IPsec Add-on](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/index.html).

### Authentication

PCC service instances are created with three default GemFire user roles for
interacting with clusters:

- A cluster operator manages the GemFire cluster and can access
region data.
- A developer can access region data.
- A gateway sender propagates region data to another PCC service instance.

All client apps, gfsh, and JMX clients must authenticate as
one of these user roles to access the cluster.

The identifiers assigned for these roles are detailed in
[Create Service Keys](developer.html#create-service-key).


### Authorization

Each user role is given predefined permissions for cluster operations.
To accomplish a cluster operation,
the user authenticates using one of the roles.
Prior to initiating the requested operation,
there is a verification that the
authenticated user role has the permission authorized to do the operation.
Here are the permissions that each user role has:

- The  cluster operator role has 
`CLUSTER:WRITE`,
`CLUSTER:READ`,
`CLUSTER:MANAGE:DEPLOY`,
`CLUSTER:MANAGE:GATEWAY`,
`DATA:MANAGE`,
`DATA:WRITE`,
 and `DATA:READ` permissions.
- The developer role has
`CLUSTER:READ`,
`DATA:WRITE`,
and `DATA:READ` permissions.
- The gateway sender role has `DATA:WRITE` permission.

More details about these permissions are in the Pivotal GemFire manual under [Implementing Authorization](http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/geode/managing/security/implementing_authorization.html).
