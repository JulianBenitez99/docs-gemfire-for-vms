Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC) is a high-performance, high-availability caching layer for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).
PCC offers an in-memory key-value store. It delivers low-latency responses to a large number of concurrent data-access requests.

PCC provides a service broker to create in-memory data clusters on demand.
These clusters are dedicated to the PCF space and tuned for specific use cases defined by your service plan.
Service operators can create multiple plans to support different use cases.

PCC uses Pivotal GemFire. The [Pivotal GemFire API Documentation](http://gemfire-apis.docs.pivotal.io/) details the API for client access to data objects within Pivotal GemFire.
PCC supports writing JavaScript apps with the
[Cloud Cache Node.js Client](https://gemfire-nodeclient.docs.pivotal.io).

This documentation performs the following functions:

* Describes the features and architecture of PCC
* Provides the PCF operator with instructions for installing, configuring, and maintaining PCC
* Provides app developers instructions for choosing a service plan and creating and deleting PCC service instances
* Provides app developers instructions for binding apps

## Quick App Development

A quick way to try out Cloud Cache is by using 
[Pivotal Web Services](https://run.pivotal.io/) (PWS)
to spin up a Cloud Cache service instance from the PWS marketplace.
Cloud Cache on PWS is intended for use in proof of concept designs only.
It is not for production workloads.
There are no high availability guarantees (or any other guarantees)
provided for Cloud Cache service instances on PWS.

The [Cloud Cache Developer Guide](https://docs.pivotal.io/cloud-cache-dev/)
features environment setup details and examples to help developers get
started with Cloud Cache.
