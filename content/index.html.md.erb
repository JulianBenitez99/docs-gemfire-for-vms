<%=vars.product_full%> is a high-performance, high-availability caching layer for <%=vars.app_runtime_full%> (<%=vars.app_runtime_abbr%>).
<%=vars.product_short%> offers an in-memory key-value store. It delivers low-latency responses to a large number of concurrent data-access requests.

<%=vars.product_short%> provides a service broker to create in-memory data clusters on demand.
These clusters are dedicated to the <%=vars.app_runtime_abbr%> space and tuned for specific use cases defined by your service plan.
Service operators can create multiple plans to support different use cases.

<%=vars.product_short%> uses <%=vars.component_product%>. The [<%=vars.component_product%> API Documentation](http://gemfire-apis.docs.pivotal.io/) details the API for client access to data objects within <%=vars.component_product%>.
<%=vars.product_short%> supports writing JavaScript apps with the [VMware Tanzu GemFire Node.jsÂ® Client](https://gemfire-nodeclient.docs.pivotal.io).

This documentation performs the following functions:

* Describes the features and architecture of <%=vars.product_short%>
* Provides the <%=vars.app_runtime_full%> operator with instructions for installing, configuring, and maintaining <%=vars.product_short%> 
* Provides app developers instructions for choosing a service plan and creating and deleting <%=vars.product_short%> service instances
* Provides app developers instructions for binding apps

## Quick App Development

A quick way to try out <%=vars.product_short%> is by using 
[Pivotal Web Services](https://run.pivotal.io/) (PWS)
to spin up a <%=vars.product_short%> service instance from the PWS marketplace.
<%=vars.product_short%> on PWS is intended for use in proof of concept designs only.
It is not for production workloads.
There are no high availability guarantees (or any other guarantees)
provided for <%=vars.product_short%> service instances on PWS.

The [<%=vars.product_short%> Developer Guide](https://docs.pivotal.io/cloud-cache-dev/)
features environment setup details and examples to help developers get 
started with <%=vars.product_short%>.
