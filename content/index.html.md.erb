    upgrade to a supported version.</p>

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC) is a high-performance, high-availability caching layer for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).
PCC offers an in-memory key-value store. It delivers low-latency responses to a large number of concurrent data access requests.

PCC provides a service broker to create in-memory data clusters on demand.
These clusters are dedicated to the PCF space and tuned for specific use cases defined by your service plan.
Service operators can create multiple plans to support different use cases.

PCC uses Pivotal GemFire. The [Pivotal GemFire API Documentation](http://gemfire-apis.docs.pivotal.io/) details the API for client access to data objects within Pivotal GemFire.

This documentation performs the following functions:

- Describes the features and architecture of PCC
- Provides the PCF operator with instructions for installing, configuring, and maintaining PCC
- Provides app developers instructions for choosing a service plan, creating and deleting PCC service instances, and binding apps

## <a id='architecture'></a>Architecture

PCC deploys cache clusters that use Pivotal GemFire to provide high availability, replication guarantees, and eventual consistency.

When you first spin up a cluster, you will have three locators and at least four servers.

When a client connects to the cluster, it first connects to a locator. The locator replies with the IP address of a server for it to talk to. The client then connects to that server.

## <a id='recommended-usage'></a>Recommended Usage and Limitations

- PCC can be used as a cache. It supports the [look-aside cache pattern](https://content.pivotal.io/blog/an-introduction-to-look-aside-vs-inline-caching-patterns).
- PCC can be used to store objects in key/value format, where value can be any object.
- PCC works with gfsh. You can only use the gfsh version that matches this release's version of GemFire.
For the version of GemFire supported in this release, see [Product Snapshot](#snapshot), above.
- Any gfsh command not explained in the PCC documentation is **not supported**.
- PCC supports basic OQL queries, with no support for joins.

### Limitations

- Scale down of the cluster is not supported.
- Plan migrations, for example, `-p` flag with the `cf update-service` command, are not supported.
- WAN (Cross Data Center) replication is not supported.
- Persistent regions are not supported.

## <a id='security'></a>Security

Pivotal recommends that you do the following:

- Run PCC in its own network
- Use a load balancer to block direct, outside access to the Gorouter

To allow PCC network access from apps, you must create application security groups that allow access on the following ports:

* 1099
* 8080
* 40404
* 55221

For more information, see the PCF [Application Security Groups](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html#creating-groups) topic.

### Authentication

Clusters are created with two default users: `cluster_operator` and `developer`.
A cluster can only be accessed using one of these two users.
All client applications, gfsh, and JMX clients must authenticate as one of these users accounts to access the cluster.

### Authorization

Default user roles `cluster_operator` and `developer` have different permissions:

- `cluster_operator` role has `CLUSTER:WRITE`, `CLUSTER:READ`, `DATA:MANAGE`, `DATA:WRITE`, and `DATA:READ` permissions.
- `developer` role has `CLUSTER:READ`, `DATA:WRITE`, and `DATA:READ` permissions.

You can find more details about these permissions in the Pivotal GemFire [Implementing Authorization](http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/geode/managing/security/implementing_authorization.html) topic.
