title: Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Cache
---

Upgrade minor release versions from your currently deployed version
to the target version in sequential order.
For example, PCC v1.2 must be upgraded to PCC v1.3 prior to
upgrading to PCC v1.4.
Note that each PCC release is compatible with two
Pivotal Application Service (PAS) and Ops Manager versions,
as specified in the [Product Snapshot](product-snapshot.html).
Incorporate those upgrades to PAS and Ops Manager in your upgrade process 
as required to maintain compatibility,
as described in
[Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html).

Follow the steps below to upgrade PCC:

1. Download the new version of the tile from the Pivotal Network.
1. Upload the product to Ops Manager.
1. Click **Add** next to the uploaded product.
1. Click on the Cloud Cache tile and configure the upgrade options.
    - To try the upgrade on a small number of service instances first, set the quantity of canary service instances as described in [Service Instance Upgrades](install-configure.html#parallel-upgrades). 
    - Set the number of instances that are to be upgraded in parallel as described in [Service Instance Upgrades](install-configure.html#parallel-upgrades).
    - Make sure that under the **Errands** section, the **Upgrade All 
    Service Instances Post-Deploy Errand** is Default (On). 
    **Save** the change.

1.  Optionally, if you are using Ops Manager v2.3 or later, click **Review Pending Changes** (see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/review-pending-changes.html)).
1.  Click **Apply Changes**.
