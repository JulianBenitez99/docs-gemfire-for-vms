title: Upgrading VMware Tanzu GemFire
---

You can upgrade directly to <%=vars.product_full%> version <%=vars.product_version%> from the latest patch release of versions <%=vars.product_short%> 1.9 or later.
This "jump upgrade" is a two-step process:

1. [Verify that your current version of <%=vars.product_short%> is up-to-date.](#upgrade-verify-current-version)
2. [Follow the upgrade procedure described here](#upgrade-procedure).

## <a id=upgrade-verify-current-version></a> Verify that Your Current Version is Up-to-date

Verify that your current version of <%=vars.product_short%> has been updated to its latest patch
release.  See [Product Snapshot and Version Compatibility](https://docs-pcf-staging.tas.vmware.com/p-cloud-cache/1-14/product-snapshot.html)
to identify the latest patch for your current minor version. If you have not installed the latest
patch, then do so.

### <a id=upgrade-version-specific-notes></a>Version-specific Upgrade Notes

- Each <%=vars.product_short%> release is compatible with two
<%=vars.app_runtime_full%> (<%=vars.app_runtime_abbr%>) and <%=vars.ops_manager%> versions.
Incorporate those upgrades to <%=vars.app_runtime_abbr%> and <%=vars.ops_manager%> in your upgrade process 
as required to maintain compatibility, as described in
[Upgrading <%=vars.ops_manager%>](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html).


- If your application connects via the Services Gateway feature, you must first upgrade to
<%=vars.product_short%> v1.13.3 before upgrading further. Then upgrade to 1.14, unbind,
rebind and restart your application.

- To upgrade to v1.9 from earlier releases, you must upgrade minor releases sequential order.
For example, <%=vars.product_full%> v1.7 must be upgraded to <%=vars.product_short%> v1.8
prior to upgrading to <%=vars.product_short%> v1.9.

- <%=vars.product_name%> version 1.13.1, included an Apache Geode v1.13.2
performance improvement that increased the defaults for maximum
number of pooled message processor threads and maximum partitioned region message processor
threads.
<br /><br />
If you are upgrading from a version of <%=vars.product_name%> earlier than version 1.13.1, and your system had been hitting the old, lower default
maximums, then upgrading to <%=vars.product_version%> may cause increased use of system resources as the system is no longer
constrained to the old values. If your system depends on constraining system resources to the old
default values, you can set these properties explicitly using DistributionManager.MAX_THREADS and
DistributionManager.MAX_PR_THREADS, respectively.
<br /><br />
The following table shows the old and new maximum values.

| System Resource | Old Default Value | New Default Value |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| DistributionManager.MAX_THREADS    | 100        | 1000 |
| DistributionManager.MAX_PR_THREADS | The greater of (CPUs * 4) or 16 | The greater of (CPUs * 32) or 200 |


## <a id=upgrade-procedure></a> Upgrade Procedure

Follow these steps to upgrade <%=vars.product_short%>:

1. Download the new version of the tile from <%=vars.pivnet%>.

1. Click **Add** next to the uploaded product.
1. Click on the <%=vars.product_short%> tile and configure the upgrade options.
    - To try the upgrade on a small number of service instances first, set the quantity of canary service instances as described in [Service Instance Upgrades](install-configure.html#parallel-upgrades). 
    - Set the number of instances that are to be upgraded in parallel as described in [Service Instance Upgrades](install-configure.html#parallel-upgrades).
    - Under the **Errands** section, choose the **Default (On)** value
    for the **Upgrade All Service Instances** post-deploy errand.
    **Save** the change.

1.  Click **Apply Changes**.

##<a id='enable-individual-upgrades'></a>Enable Individual Service Instance Upgrades

The default upgrade path upgrades all service instances as a result of
a tile upgrade.
This operation can take a lengthy amount of time.
To expedite upgrades,
an operator can permit developers to upgrade their own service instances
once the tile has been upgraded.

An operator enables individual service instance upgrades during 
tile installation.
This feature requires <%=vars.app_runtime_abbr%>/<%=vars.ops_manager%> 2.7 or a higher version
and works for upgrading from <%=vars.product_short%> 1.9.0 to a higher version.

Within the <%=vars.product_short%> tile,
in the **Errands** section,
the default for the
**Upgrade All Service Instances** errand,
which upgrades all service instances, appears as:

![Individual Service Instance Upgrades Disabled](indiv-upgrades-disabled.png)

To change the state of this errand such that individual
service instance upgrades are enabled,
choose **Off** for this errand:

![Individual Service Instance Upgrades Enabled](indiv-upgrades-enabled.png)

Click **Save**.

Once individual service instance upgrades are enabled,
the developer upgrades an individual service instance following
the instructions in [Upgrade a Single Service Instance](dev-upgrade.html).
