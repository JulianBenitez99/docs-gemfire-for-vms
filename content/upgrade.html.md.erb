title: Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Cache
---

Upgrade minor release versions from your currently deployed version
to the target version in sequential order.
For example, PCC v1.2 must be upgraded to PCC v1.3 prior to
upgrading to PCC v1.4.
Note that each PCC release is compatible with two
Pivotal Application Service (PAS) and Ops Manager versions,
as specified in the [Product Snapshot](product-snapshot.html).
Incorporate those upgrades to PAS and Ops Manager in your upgrade process 
as required to maintain compatibility,
as described in
[Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html).

Follow the steps below to upgrade PCC:

1. Download the new version of the tile from the Pivotal Network.
1. Upload the product to Ops Manager.
1. Click **Add** next to the uploaded product.
1. Click on the Cloud Cache tile and configure the upgrade options.
    - To try the upgrade on a small number of service instances first, set the quantity of canary service instances as described in [Service Instance Upgrades](install-configure.html#parallel-upgrades). 
    - Set the number of instances that are to be upgraded in parallel as described in [Service Instance Upgrades](install-configure.html#parallel-upgrades).
    - Under the **Errands** section, choose the **Default (On)** value
    for the **Upgrade All Service Instances** post-deploy errand. 
    **Save** the change.

1.  Click **Review Pending Changes** (see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/review-pending-changes.html)).
1.  Click **Apply Changes**.

##<a id='enable-individual-upgrades'></a>Enable Individual Service Instance Upgrades

The default upgrade path upgrades all service instances as a result of
a tile upgrade.
This operation can take a lengthy amount of time.
If instead, developers should be allowed to upgrade their own service instances
once the tile has been upgraded,
the default behavior may be changed.

An operator enables individual service instance upgrades during 
tile installation.
This feature requires PAS/Ops Manager 2.7 or a higher version
and works for upgrading from Cloud Cache 1.9.0 to a higher version.

To enable individual service instance upgrades,
click on the Cloud Cache tile,
then click on the **Errands** section.
Before being enabled, the default **Upgrade All Service Instances** errand will
appear in the default state of disabled:

![Individual Service Instance Upgrades Disabled](indiv-upgrades-disabled.png)

Change the state of this errand to enabled by choosing **Off**:

![Individual Service Instance Upgrades Enabled](indiv-upgrades-enabled.png)

Click **Save**.

Once individual service instance upgrades are enabled,
the developer upgrades an individual service instance following
the instructions in [Upgrade a Single Service Instance](dev-upgrade.html).
