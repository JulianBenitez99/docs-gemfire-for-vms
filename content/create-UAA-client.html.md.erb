title: Create a UAA Client
---

Extra configuration is required when defining users that have specific
security roles with an
authentication and enterprise single sign-on (SSO) such as LDAP.


Authenticating using an authentication and enterprise SSO system
such as LDAP uses the User Account and Authentication (UAA) server.
Access the UAA server through its command-line interface, UAAC.

Create a client for use with PCC with the command:

```
uaac client add cloudcache_gfsh --scope="PCC_*" --secret="THE-SECRET"
   --authorized_grant_types=password
```
Replace `THE-SECRET` with your chosen password (secret) for this client.
The remainder of the command is exactly as shown.
