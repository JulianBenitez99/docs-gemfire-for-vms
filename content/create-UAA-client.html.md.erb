title: Create a UAA Client
---

Extra configuration is required when defining users that have specific
security roles with an
authentication and enterprise single sign-on (SSO) such as LDAP.

Authenticating using an authentication and enterprise SSO system
such as LDAP uses the User Account and Authentication (UAA) server.
Access the UAA server through its command-line interface, UAAC.

When enabling the use of an authentication and enterprise
single sign-on (SSO) such as LDAP during PCC tile configuration,
you will specify a UAA client,
as described in [Security](install-configure.html#security-section).
This procedure creates that UAA client.

Create a UAA client for use in tile configuration with the command:

```
uaac client add cloudcache_gfsh --scope="PCC_*" --secret="THE-SECRET"
   --authorized_grant_types=password
```
Replace `THE-SECRET` with your chosen password (secret) for this UAA client.
The remainder of the command is exactly as shown.
The UAA client name is `cloudcache_gfsh`.
