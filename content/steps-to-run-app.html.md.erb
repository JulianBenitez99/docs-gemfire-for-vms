## <a id="java-build-pack-requirement"></a> Java Build Pack Requirements

To ensure that your app can use all the features from <%=vars.product_full%>,
use the latest buildpack.
The buildpack is available on GitHub at [cloudfoundry/java-buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack).


## <a id="bind-service"></a> Bind an App to a Service Instance

Binding your apps to a service instance enables the apps to connect to the service instance and read or write data to the region.
Run `cf bind-service APP-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` to bind an app to your service instance.
Replace `APP-NAME` with the name of the app.
Replace `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` with the name you chose for your service instance.

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf bind-service my-app my-cloudcache
</pre>

Binding an app to the service instance provides connection information through the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
Your app can use this information to configure components, such as the GemFire client cache, to use the service instance.
