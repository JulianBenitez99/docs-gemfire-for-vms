title: Service Instance Sharing
---

Service instance sharing permits read-only access 
to a service within one space by an app within a different space.

Setting up sharing has two steps:

1. Set up service instance sharing
2. Bind the app to the shared service instance

The instructions require identification of the org and the space of 
both the service instance and the app.
This diagram names the components for use in the configuration
instructions.
Service instance X resides within space C, which is part of org A.
App Y resides within space D, which is part of org B.

## <a id="set-up-sharing"></a> Set Up Service Instance Sharing

The Cloud Cache service instance must be up and running prior to
setting up service instance sharing.

To set up service instance sharing:

1. Do a `cf login`, and target the space that contains the service
to be shared: org A, space C.

2. To enable instance sharing, invoke the command:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cf enable-feature-flag service_instance_sharing
    </pre>

3. To specify the space that the service will be shared with,
invoke a command of the form

    ```
    cf share-service SERVICE-X -s SPACE-D -o ORG-B
    ```

    Replace `SERVICE-X` with the Cloud Cache service instance name.
    Replace `SPACE-D` with the space name where the app resides.
    Replace `ORG-B` with the org name where the app resides.

## <a id="binding-sharing"></a> Bind an App to a Shared Service Instance

The app must be bound to the shared service instance prior to starting
the app.

To bind the app to the shared service instance:

1. Do a `cf login`, and target the org and space that contains the app:
org B, space D.

2. Verify that the Cloud Cache service instances is available and 
has been set up as shared across the spaces in the output of the
command:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cf services
    </pre>

3. Bind the app with a command of the form

    ```
    cf bind APP-Y SERVICE-X
    ```

    Replace `SERVICE-X` with the Cloud Cache service instance name.
    Replace `APP-Y` with the name of the app.
