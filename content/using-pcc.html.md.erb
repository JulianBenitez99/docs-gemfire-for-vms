## <a id="create-regions"></a> Create Regions with gfsh

After connecting with gfsh with a role that is able to manage a cluster's data,
you can define a new cache region.

The following command creates a partitioned region with a single redundant copy:

<pre class='terminal'>
gfsh>create region --name=my-cache-region --type=PARTITION_REDUNDANT_HEAP_LRU
     Member      | Status
---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------
cacheserver-z2-1 | Region "/my-cache-region" created on "cacheserver-z2-1"
cacheserver-z3-2 | Region "/my-cache-region" created on "cacheserver-z3-2"
cacheserver-z1-0 | Region "/my-cache-region" created on "cacheserver-z1-0"
cacheserver-z1-3 | Region "/my-cache-region" created on "cacheserver-z1-3"
</pre>

See [Region Design](../app-development.html#region-design)
for guidelines on choosing a region type.

You can test the newly created region by writing and reading values with gfsh:

<pre class='terminal'>
gfsh>put --region=/my-cache-region --key=test --value=thevalue
Result      : true
Key Class   : java.lang.String
Key         : test
Value Class : java.lang.String
Old Value   : NULL


gfsh>get --region=/my-cache-region --key=test
Result      : true
Key Class   : java.lang.String
Key         : test
Value Class : java.lang.String
Value       : thevalue
</pre>

In practice, you should perform these get/put operations from a deployed PCF app. To do this, you must bind the service instance to these apps.

## <a id="disk-stores"></a> Working with Disk Stores

Persistent regions and regions that overflow upon eviction use
disk stores.
Use `gfsh` to create or destroy a disk store.

### <a id="disk-store-create"></a> Create a Disk Store

To create a disk store for use with a persistent or overflow
type of region:

1. Use the directions in 
[Connect with gfsh over HTTPS](accessing-instance.html#gfsh-connect-https)
to connect to the PCC service instance with
a role that is able to manage a cluster's data.


2. Create the disk store with a gfsh command of the form:

    ```
    create disk-store --name=<name-of-disk-store>
     --dir=<relative/path/to/diskstore/directory>
    ```

    Specify a relative path for the disk store location.
    That relative path will be created within `/var/vcap/store/gemfire-server/`.
    For more details on further options, see the Pivotal GemFire
    [create disk-store Command Reference Page](http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/geode/tools_modules/gfsh/command-pages/create.html#topic_bkn_zty_ck).

### <a id="disk-store-destroy"></a> Destroy a Disk Store

To destroy a disk store:

1. Use the directions in 
[Connect with gfsh over HTTPS](accessing-instance.html#gfsh-connect-https)
to connect to the PCC service instance with
a role that is able to manage a cluster's data.

2. Destroy the disk store with a gfsh command of the form:

    ```
    destroy disk-store --name=<name-of-disk-store>
    ```

    For more details on further options, see the Pivotal GemFire
    [destroy disk-store Command Reference Page](http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/95/geode/tools_modules/gfsh/command-pages/destroy.html#topic_yfr_l2z_ck).

## <a id="java-build-pack-requirement"></a> Java Build Pack Requirements

To ensure that your app can use all the features from PCC,
use the latest buildpack.
The buildpack is available on GitHub at [cloudfoundry/java-buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack).


## <a id="bind-service"></a> Bind an App to a Service Instance

Binding your apps to a service instance enables the apps to connect to the service instance and read or write data to the region.
Run `cf bind-service APP-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` to bind an app to your service instance.
Replace `APP-NAME` with the name of the app.
Replace `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` with the name you chose for your service instance.

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf bind-service my-app my-cloudcache
</pre>

Binding an app to the service instance provides connection information through the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
Your app can use this information to configure components, such as the GemFire client cache, to use the service instance.

## <a id="pulse"></a> Use the Pulse Dashboard

You can access the Pulse dashboard for a service instance in a web browser
using the Pulse URL specified in the service key you created following the
directions in [Create Service Keys](accessing-instance.html#create-service-key).

## <a id="nozzle"></a> Access Service Instance Metrics

To access service metrics, you must have **Enable Plan** selected under **Service Plan Access** on the page where you configure your tile properties. (For details, see the [Configure Service Plans](install-configure.html#plan-config) page.)

PCC service instances output metrics to the Loggregator Firehose. You can use the
Firehose plugin  to
view metrics output on the cf CLI directly. For more information about using the Firehose plugin, see [Installing the Loggregator Firehose Plugin for CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/loggregator/cli-plugin.html). 

You can also connect the output to a Firehose nozzle. Nozzles are programs that consume data from the Loggregator Firehose. For example, to connect the output to the nozzle for Datadog, see [Datadog Firehose Nozzle](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-attic/datadog-firehose-nozzle) on GitHub.

PCC supports metrics for the whole cluster and metrics for each member.
Each server and locator in the cluster outputs metrics.

### Service Instance (Cluster-wide) Metrics
* serviceinstance.MemberCount: the number of VMs in the cluster
* serviceinstance.TotalHeapSize: the total MBs of heap available in the cluster
* serviceinstance.UsedHeapSize: the total MBs of heap in use in the cluster

### Member (per-VM) Metrics
* member.GarbageCollectionCount: the number of JVM garbage collections that have occurred on this member since startup
* member.CpuUsage: the percentage of CPU time used by the GemFire process
* member.GetsAvgLatency: the avg latency of GET requests to this GemFire member
* member.PutsAvgLatency: the avg latency of PUT requests to this GemFire member
* member.JVMPauses: the number of JVM pauses that have occurred on this member since startup
* member.FileDescriptorLimit: the number of files this member allows to be open at once
* member.TotalFileDescriptorOpen: the number of files this member has open now
* member.FileDescriptorRemaining: the number of files that this member could open before hitting its limit
* member.TotalHeapSize: the number of megabytes allocated for the heap
* member.UsedHeapSize: the number of megabytes currently in use for the heap
* member.UnusedHeapSizePercentage: the percentage of the total heap size that is not currently being used

## <a id="nozzle-service-metrics"></a> Access Service Broker Metrics

Service broker metrics are on by default and can be accessed through the Loggregator Firehose CLI plugin. For more information, see [Installing the Loggregator Firehose Plugin for CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/loggregator/cli-plugin.html). For more information about broker metrics, see [On Demand Broker Metrics](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/0-16/operating.html#metrics).

## <a id="exporting_logs"></a> Export gfsh Logs

You can get logs and `.gfs` stats files from your PCC service instances using the `export logs` command in gfsh.

1. Use the [Connect with gfsh over HTTPS](#gfsh-connect-https) procedure to
connect to the service instance for which you want to see logs.
Use a role that can read cluster information.
1. Run `export logs`.
If you see a message of the form
<pre class='terminal'>Estimated exported logs expanded file size = 289927115, file-size-limit = 104857600. To disable exported logs file size check use option "--file-size-limit=0".</pre>
your logs exceed an expanded size of 100 megabytes,
and they were not exported.
To export in this case, use the gfsh command:

    <code>export logs --file-size-limit=0</code>
1. Find the ZIP file in the directory where you started gfsh. 
   This file contains a folder for each member of the cluster.
   The member folder contains the associated log files and stats files for that member.

For more information about the gfsh export command,
see the [gfsh export documentation](https://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/geode/tools_modules/gfsh/command-pages/export.html).

## <a id="deploy-app-jars"></a> Deploy an App JAR File to the Servers

You can deploy or redeploy an app JAR file to the servers in the cluster.

To do an initial deploy of an app JAR file after connecting within gfsh
using credentials that can manage the cluster,
run this gfsh command:

<code>deploy --jar=PATH-TO-JAR/FILENAME.jar</code>

For example,

<pre class='terminal'> gfsh>deploy --jar=working-directory/myJar.jar </pre>

To redeploy an app JAR file after connecting within gfsh
using credentials that can manage the cluster,
do the following: 		

1. Run this gfsh command to deploy the updated JAR file:

    <code>deploy --jar=PATH-TO-UPDATED-JAR/FILENAME.jar</code>

    For example,

    <pre class='terminal'>gfsh>deploy --jar=newer-jars/myJar.jar</pre>

1. Run this command to restart the cluster and load the updated JAR file:

     <code> cf update-service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME -c '{"restart": true}' </code>

     For example,

     <pre class='terminal'>$ cf update-service my-service-instance -c '{"restart": true}'</code>

## <a id="use-GGC"></a> Use the GemFire-Greenplum Connector

The GemFire-Greenplum connector permits the transfer of a PCC region
out to a Greenplum database table or the transfer of a Greenplum database table
into a PCC region.
`gfsh` commands set up the configuration and initiate transfers.
See the
[GemFire-Greenplum Connector](http://ggc.docs.pivotal.io)
documentation for details.

Connect in `gfsh` with a role that can both manage the cluster and
read and write cluster data.
