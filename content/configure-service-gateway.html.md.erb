title: Configure a Service Gateway
---

A service gateway enables communication from an app to the
<%=vars.product_short%> service instance.
The running [App's Location](architecture.html#AppLocation) determines
whether a service gateway is required.

The operator needs to complete two items to enable a service gateway:

- With a VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs)
version 2.10 deployment, follow the directions to
[Enable TCP Routing](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-10/adminguide/enabling-tcp-routing.html).
Note the range entered for the **TCP routing ports**.
One port from this range will be required to configure
the <%=vars.product_short%> tile.

- Configure the <%=vars.product_short%> tile to enable the service gateway
as described in [Settings: Enable Creation of a Service Gateway](install-configure.html#settings-sg).
