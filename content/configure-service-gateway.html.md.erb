title: Configure a Service Gateway
---

A service gateway enables communication from an app to the
<%=vars.product_short%> service instance.
The running [App's Location](architecture.html#AppLocation) determines
whether a service gateway is required.

The operator needs to complete two items to enable a service gateway:

- With a VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs)
version 2.9 or 2.10 deployment, follow the directions to
[Enable TCP Routing](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-10/adminguide/enabling-tcp-routing.html).
This will include the two cf CLI commands:

    ```
    cf create-shared-domain tcp.${BOSH_ENV_NAME}.cf-app.com --router-group default-tcp
    ```
    ```
    cf update-quota default --reserved-route-ports N
    ```
    Replace `N` with an integer that is at least as large as the
    quantity of service instances that will be exposed to apps running
    in locations that are not within the services foundation.

    Note the range entered for the **TCP routing ports**.
    One port from this range will be required to configure
    the <%=vars.product_short%> tile.

- Configure the <%=vars.product_short%> tile to enable the service gateway
as described in [Settings: Enable Creation of a Service Gateway](install-configure.html#settings-sg).
