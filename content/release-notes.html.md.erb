## <a id='v170'></a>v1.7.0

**Release Date:**  March 29, 2019

Features included in this release:

- EDIT THIS ONE. UAA integration
- PCC requires TLS encryption for using gfsh and Pulse.
Follow the instructions in [Preparing for TLS](prepare-TLS.html) to
set up TLS encryption.
- EDIT THIS ONE. More metrics.

available memory for GemFire servers is reduced to allow enough memory

- EDIT THIS ONE. Simplified TLS setup for Spring Boot applications,
as detailed in [Developing an App Under TLS](tls-enabled-app.html).
