## <a id='v192'></a>v1.9.2

**Release Date:**  January 31, 2020

Features included in this release:

- Cloud Cache supports CA certificate rotation.
See [Managing Certificates](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-cloud-cache/1-9/rotating-ca.html) for details.
- Fixed a bug which caused installation to fail when uppercase letters were
used in network names.
- Upgraded the underlying Go language version for various internal components.
- Cloud Cache 1.9.2 runs Pivotal GemFire 9.8.6.

## <a id='v191'></a>v1.9.1

**Release Date:**  October 24, 2019

Features included in this release:

- Cloud Cache 1.9.1 runs Pivotal GemFire 9.8.4.
- The `cf marketplace` command displays the installed Cloud Cache and GemFire versions.
- Fixed a bug which prevented successful upgrade from Cloud Cache 1.8 to Cloud Cache 1.9.0
for version 1.8 service instances that have TLS encryption enabled.
- Fixed a bug in the `mem-check` post deploy errand that occurred when
more than 50 service instances were present.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Letters within the service network
name must be lowercase letters for v1.9.1.
Uppercase letters in the service network name will cause
the installation to fail,
apps will not be able to connect to the service instance,
and service instance creation will fail.
Version 1.9.2 fixes this issue, so upgrade to the most recent
1.9 version to avoid this issue.
