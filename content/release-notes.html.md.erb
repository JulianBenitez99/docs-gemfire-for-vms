## <a id='known-issues'></a>Known Issues

A v4.36 Java buildpack is incompatible with
an app that will be bound to a session replication service.
Any Tanzu Application Service (TAS) upgrade to version 

- 2.10.12, 2.10.11
- 2.9.20, 2.9.19
- 2.8.26, 2.8.25
- 2.7.32, 2.7.31

will contain a v4.36 Java buildpack.
Apps with this issue will fail to start due to a version mismatch between
the app and the <%=vars.product_short%> cluster servers.
See [Java Buildpack Version Incompatibility](session-caching.html#buildpack-issues) for details
on how to fix the issue.
