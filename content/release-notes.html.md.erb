## <a id='v150'></a>v1.5.0

**Release Date:**  June 1, 2018

Features included in this release:

- PCC is now running Pivotal GemFire SOME VERSION NUMBER.
Using `gfsh` with this GemFire version requires a JDK or JRE
with Java 8 release 121 or a more recent version 8 update.

## <a id='v15-known-issues'></a>Known Issues

- If you upgrade to PCC v1.3 as part of the process of upgrading to this
1.5 release, and you created service keys on PCC before you installed v1.3:
delete and recreate the service keys so that users are properly
assigned roles for authentication and authorization within the cluster.
Then, rebind all your apps.
For information about how to perform these tasks,
see [Delete a Service Key](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/devguide/services/service-keys.html),
[Create Service Keys](accessing-instance.html#create-service-key),
and [Bind an App to a Service Instance](using-pcc.html#bind-service).

- A Pulse topology diagram might not be accurate and might show more members than are actually in the cluster. However, the numerical value displayed on the top bar is accurate.

- Current versions of the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (CLI) tool
have a known bug that omits the documentation URL when
using the `cf service` command.
