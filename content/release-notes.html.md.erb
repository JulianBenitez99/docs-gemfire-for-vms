Bug fixes:

- For slow IaaSes, where the server takes a long time to start up, the cluster fails to start.

  preventing creation of service instances.


Known issues in this release:

- If you are upgrading to Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC) v1.3.0 and you created service keys on PCC before you installed v1.3.0:
  delete and recreate the service keys so that users are assigned roles in the cluster. Then, rebind all your apps.
  For information about how to perform these tasks, see [Delete a Service Key](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/devguide/services/service-keys.html#delete), 
  [Create Service Keys](developer.html#create-service-key), and [Bind an App to a Service Instance](developer.html#bind-service).
