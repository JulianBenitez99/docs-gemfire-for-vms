Known issues in this release:

- If you are upgrading to Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC) v1.3.0 and you created service keys on PCC before you installed v1.3.0:
  delete and recreate the service keys so that users are assigned roles in the cluster. Then, rebind all your apps.
  For information about how to perform these tasks, see [Delete a Service Key](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/devguide/services/service-keys.html),
  [Create Service Keys](accessing-instance.html#create-service-key), and [Bind an App to a Service Instance](using-pcc.html#bind-service).

- A Pulse topology diagram might not be accurate and might show more members than are actually in the cluster. However, the numerical value displayed on the top bar is accurate.
