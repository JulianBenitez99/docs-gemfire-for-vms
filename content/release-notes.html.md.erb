that can be open concurrently.

## <a id='v16-known-issues'></a>Known Issues

- Installations using HTTP session state replication have a known issue
issue and workaround to correct the issue.
The HTTP session module creates its region that holds metadata on only
one server within a cluster.
The region needs to be hosted on all the servers.

    To correct the issue on a running cluster, connect to the cluster
    using the GemFire cluster operator credentials,
    and run a single `gfsh` command
    to create the metadata region on all servers.
    The command has the form:

    ```
    create region --name=REGION-NAME --type=REGION-SHORTCUT \
     --enable-statistics \
     --entry-idle-time-custom-expiry=org.apache.geode.modules.util.SessionCustomExpiry
    ```
    If the metadata region's name or type have not been changed from their
    default, use this `gfsh` command:

    ```
    gfsh>create region --name=gemfire_modules_sessions --type=PARTITION_REDUNDANT \
     --enable-statistics \
     --entry-idle-time-custom-expiry=org.apache.geode.modules.util.SessionCustomExpiry
    ```

    For installations that have changed the metadata region's name or type,
    substitute the changed values for `REGION-NAME` and `REGION-SHORTCUT`
    in the command.

    You can verify that the region is hosted on all servers with the
    `gfsh` command:

    ```
    gfsh>describe region --name=gemfire_modules_sessions
    ```
- Current versions of the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (CLI) tool
have a known bug that omits the documentation URL when
using the `cf service` command.
