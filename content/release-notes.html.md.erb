## <a id='v1.0'></a>v1.0.0

**Release Date:** March 31, 2017

Requirement: PCC v1.0.0 requires PCF with Elastic Runtime v1.9.11 or above.

Features: 

- Support for application look-aside cache pattern
- Multi AZ support
- On-demand provisioning
- MVP role-based access control
- Quotas, both for service instances and for number of servers in a cluster
- GemFire v9.0.2
- Manage and configure clusters using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) service commands and the GemFire gfsh CLI

Known issues:

- The `Upgrade all service instances` errand can only upgrade the first 50 instances created.
- On PCF for Google Cloud Platform deployments, Ops Manager service network VMs are not assigned the correct firewall rules. 
As a result, these VMs cannot communicate with the BOSH Director, and the PCC broker will fail to create service instances. As a workaround, modify your firewall to use subnet CIDR-based rules.
- The PCC broker will accept requests to modify instances that have ongoing BOSH operations, resulting in an asynchronous failure.
