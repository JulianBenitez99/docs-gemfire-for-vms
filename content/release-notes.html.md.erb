A v4.36 Java buildpack requires customization in order to work with
an app that will be bound to a session replication service.
Any Tanzu Application Service (TAS) upgrade to version 

- 2.11.0
- 2.10.12, 2.10.11
- 2.9.20, 2.9.19
- 2.8.26, 2.8.25
- 2.7.32, 2.7.31

will contain a v4.36 Java buildpack.
Therefore, any Tomcat session state caching app to be pushed will
require a Java buildpack customization of the `geode_store` version.
See [Create a Custom Buildpack](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-cloud-cache/1-12/session-caching.html#custom-ssc-buildpack) for details.
Without the correct `geode_store` version, apps will fail to start
due to a version mismatch between the app and
the <%=vars.product_short%> cluster servers.
