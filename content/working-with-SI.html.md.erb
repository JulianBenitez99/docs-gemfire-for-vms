title: Working with PCC Service Instances
---


This document describes how a Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) app developer can choose a service plan, create and delete Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC) service instances, and bind an app.

You must install the [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) (cf CLI) to run the commands in this topic.
