## <a id="starting-redis-api"></a> Starting a Tanzu GemFire Service Instance with Redis API

When a Tanzu GemFire service instance is started, the Redis API for <%=vars.product_full%> is already available.

In order to access the API, ensure that your operator has [opened port 6379 or 16379 (TLS)](on-demand-networking.html).

If you are migrating from an existing application that uses the Redis tile you will typically need to do the following:

1. Add the "redis" tag to your <%=vars.product_full%> service:
  - When creating a new service, add the option: `-t "redis"` to the [create service command](create-instance.html)
  - For an existing service, the tag can be updated:
    <pre class='terminal'>
      $ cf update-service YOUR-SERVICE-NAME -t "redis"
    </pre>

2. If your app is still bound to a Redis service, it needs to be unbound:
    <pre class='terminal'>
      $ cf unbind-service APP-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME
    </pre>

3. Bind your app to the new <%=vars.product_full%> service:
    <pre class='terminal'>
      $ cf bind-service APP-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME
    </pre>

## <a id="tls"></a> TLS

Unlike the Redis tile where both TLS and non-TLS ports can be available at the same time, only a [single port](on-demand-networking.html) is active for the Redis API for <%=vars.product_full%>.
If TLS is enabled, all connections must be made using a TLS-capable client since the non-TLS port will not be available.

## <a id="back-up"></a> Back Up and Restoration

As the Redis API does not persist any data to disk, it is not possible to back up and restore.

## <a id="enable-unsupported-commands"></a> Enable Unsupported Commands

Redis API for <%=vars.product_full%> [does not support all Redis commands](https://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/<%=vars.component_product_version_nodot%>/tools_modules/redis_api_for_geode.html#included-commands).  If you
would like to enable unsupported commands (commands that have been implemented, but not fully tested), follow these steps:

1. [Connect to your instance using gfsh](accessing-instance.html#dev-establish-https)
2. Run the following command in `gfsh`: `redis --enable-unsupported-commands`
