- **[Cluster Management Service](../../geode/configuring/running/cluster-management-service.html)**

    The cluster management service enables you to change the configuration of
the cluster (for example, create/destroy regions, indexes, or gateway receivers/senders), and have these
changes replicated on all the applicable servers and persisted in the cluster configuration service.

-   **[Automated Rebalancing of Partitioned Region Data](../../geode/developing/partitioned_regions/automated_rebalance.html)**

    The automated rebalance feature triggers a rebalance operation
based on a time schedule.
