title:  Experimental Features
---

<%=vars.product_name_long%> includes these features to allow interested developers to 
experiment with their use in their own development systems.
Feedback will help drive development of these features,
and they may be supported in future versions of the product.

These features may change in or be removed from future versions
of the product.

- **[Cluster Management Service](../../geode/configuring/running/cluster-management-service.html)**

    The cluster management service enables you to change the configuration of
the cluster (for example, create/destroy regions, indexes, or gateway receivers/senders), and have these
changes replicated on all the applicable servers and persisted in the cluster configuration service.

-   **[Redis Adapter](../../geode/tools_modules/redis_adapter.html)**

    The Redis adapter allows Geode to function as a drop-in replacement for 
a Redis data store, letting Redis applications take advantage of Geodeâ€™s 
scaling capabilities without changing their client code. 
Redis clients connect to a Geode server in the same way they connect to a 
Redis server, using an IP address and a port number.

-   **[Automated Rebalancing of Partitioned Region Data](../../geode/developing/partitioned_regions/automated_rebalance.html)**

    The automated rebalance feature triggers a rebalance operation
based on a time schedule.
