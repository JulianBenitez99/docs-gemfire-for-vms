title:  Windows/Unix/Linuxâ€”Upgrade Pivotal GemFire
---

This is the upgrade procedure to GemFire 9.0.0. 

## General Upgrade Steps

These steps identify the ordering of an upgrade.
A more detailed procedure is given below.

1.   Implement package renaming for server-side callbacks in
a test environment.
The server class path uses `geode-dependencies.jar` in place of the
no longer used `gemfire.jar`.
Also implement package renaming for any client applications
that are to be upgraded to Pivotal GemFire 9.0.0.

1.   Make backups, so you can restore 
your GemFire version 8 cluster if the upgrade does not complete
to your satisfaction.
    - Back up all existing disk-stores and data.
    - Back up all configuration files including
`geode.properties`/`gemfire.properties` 
and `.xml` configurations.

2.   Check system requirements and make changes where applicable.

3.   Shut down the cluster. 

4.   Upgrade the Java JDK to v1.8.0_92 or later, if necessary.

5.   Install the new version of GemFire,
and update environment variables to point to the new installation.

6.   Install revised server-side callbacks and any
upgraded clients.

7.  Start the cluster using the new GemFire installation.

8.  Test the new installation to assure that the cluster has been
properly redeployed.

9.  Redeploy applications.

10.  Test applications for proper functionality.

11.  Remove the old distribution to prevent unexpected version conflicts.

## Java Notes

- Pivotal GemFire 9.0 requires Java SE 8, version 92 or a more recent version.
Pivotal GemFire 8.0 was the last GemFire release to support Java SE 6.
As of this writing Java SE 7 is already End-of-Life.

- To check your current Java version, type `java -version`
 at a command-line prompt. 

- The Pivotal GemFire product download does not include Java.
You must download and install a supported JRE or JDK on each system
running GemFire.
GemFire recommends the installation of a full JDK (and not just a JRE)
to obtain better performance with `gfsh status` and `gfsh stop` commands.

## RHEL/Centos: with previous installation via RPM

RPMs existed for GemFire 8.x,
but they are not available for GemFire 9.0.
To install GemFire 9.0 on a RHEL/Centos system,
follow these upgrade procedure instructions,
with a modified final step of uninstalling the GemFire 8.x version
using `rpm -e`.

## Ubuntu: with previous installation via Debian packaging

DEBs existed for GemFire 8.x,
but they are not available for GemFire 9.0.
To install GemFire 9.0 on an Ubuntu system,
follow the upgrade procedure instructions,
with a modified final step of uninstalling the GemFire 8.x version
using `dpkg --remove` or `dpkg --purge`.

## Package Renaming

Pivotal GemFire 9.0 uses the same packages as open-source Apache Geode.
All `com.gemstone.gemfire` package names are now
`org.apache.geode`.
If you have written code that explicitly imports `gemfire` packages,
you must change those references to use the `geode` names.
This applies to all server side code.
Search and replace `com.gemstone.gemfire` with `org.apache.geode`.

The Pivotal GemFire 9.0 release is backwards compatible
with Pivotal GemFire 8.2.2 clients,
so a version 9 server will understand calls from an
8.2.2 client that uses the old `com.gemstone.gemfire` package names.
Pivotal GemFire 9.0 peers and servers are *not* compatible
with Pivotal GemFire 8.2.2 peers or servers.

Pivotal GemFire 8.2.2 clients that use continuous queries
can not work with 9.0.0 servers.
Pivotal GemFire 8.2.2 clients that use continuous queries
must be reimplemented to use the 9.0.0 package names.

Pivotal GemFire 8.2.2 clients that run functions on servers
using the `Execution` interface's `execute(Function function)` signature
can not work with 9.0.0 servers.
Pivotal GemFire 8.2.2 clients that run functions with this signature
must be reimplemented as 9.0.0 clients which use the 9.0.0 package names.

## The Upgrade Procedure, Step by Step

Follow these steps to upgrade to Pivotal GemFire 9.0.0 on Linux,
Unix, or Windows.

1.   Implement package renaming for server-side callbacks in
a test environment.
The server class path uses `geode-dependencies.jar` in place of the
no longer used `gemfire.jar`.
Also implement package renaming for any client applications
that are to be upgraded to Pivotal GemFire 9.0.0.

1.  Make backup copies of all existing disk-stores, server-side code,
configuration files, and data across the entire cluster.
To get a backup of the data that includes the most recent changes
may require that traffic across the cluster is stopped before
the backup is made.

2.  Shut down the cluster running with the prior version.
Open a `gfsh` prompt:

    ``` pre
    % gfsh
    ```

    Connect to the locator:

    ``` pre
    gfsh>connect --locator=localhost[10334]
    Connecting to Locator at [host=localhost, port=10334] ..
    Connecting to Manager at [host=172.16.139.180, port=1099] ..
    Successfully connected to: [host=172.16.139.180, port=1099]
    
    gfsh>list members
     Name   | Id
    ------- | -------------------------------------------
    server2 | 172.16.139.180(server2:29368)<v2>:35840
    locator | 172.16.139.180(locator:29181:locator):36278
    server1 | 172.16.139.180(server1:29285)<v1>:40574
    ```

    Shut down the entire cluster (by pressing Y at the prompt,
this will lose no persisted data): 

    ``` pre
    gfsh>shutdown --include-locators=true
As a lot of data in memory will be lost, including possibly events in queues,
do you really want to shutdown the entire distributed system? (Y/n): Y
succeeded in shutting down
    ```

    Since GemFire is a Java process,
to check before continuing that all GemFire members successfully stopped,
it is useful to use the JDK-included `jps` command to check running
java processes:

    ``` pre
    % jps
    29664 Jps
    ```

3.  Upgrade Java, if needed.

4.  Download the new version of GemFire from the
[Pivotal GemFire downloads page](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-gemfire).

5.  Move the compressed download to the desired installation directory,
and uncompress or expand it.
For example, to expand the compressed tar file:

    ``` pre
    % tar -xzf pivotal-gemfire-9.0.0.tar.gz
    ```
    The file name may differ from the one shown in this example.

6.  Reset all GemFire-related environment variables to point to
the new installation. For example:

    ``` pre
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_92
    export GEMFIRE=<PATH TO INSTALL LOCATION>/pivotal-gemfire-9.0.0
    export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$GEMFIRE/bin:$PATH
    ```
    To check that the system finds the new installation,
open a `gfsh` prompt and check the GemFire version:

    ``` pre
    % gfsh --version
    v9.0.0
    ```

7.  Repeat steps 3-6 on all machines within the cluster.

8.  Redeploy your environment's configuration files to
the new version installation.

9.  Install updated server code.
Point all client applications to the new installation of GemFire.

11. Restart all system members according to your usual procedures.

12. Once all systems are functioning normally and all tests are successful,
remove the old version of GemFire to reduce possibility
of version complications in the future.
    - If the old version of GemFire was installed from a ZIP file,
uninstall that old version by deleting its product tree.
    - If the old version of GemFire was installed with an RPM, uninstall using

    ``` pre
    rpm -e Pivotal_GemFire_XXX
    ```
where `XXX` is replaced by the GemFire version number and also corresponds to the name of the product installation directory.  As an example, the command for removing the GemFire 8.2.1 release would be

    ``` pre
    rpm -e Pivotal_GemFire_821
    ```
    - If the old version of GemFire was installed with DEBs, uninstall using

    ``` pre
    dpkg --remove pivotal-gemfire
    ```

## Multi-site Upgrade using WAN Gateway

Systems that have both persistent disk stores and
a bidirectional WAN gateway to replicate data among sites
can implement an upgrade that does not require system down time.
It requires multiple reconfigurations during the process,
such that each site can be individually upgraded while the rest
of the system continues.

The procedure assumes that each site has already been upgraded
to Pivotal GemFire version 8.2.2.

This diagram shows the initial state of the system.

The procedure for upgrading two sites, Site A and Site B:

1.  Reconfigure to redirect all traffic away from Site B (which will be the first site that gets upgraded).
<img src="../../images/GF9-WAN-upgrade-1.png" id="image_GF9-WAN-upgrade-1" class="image" />
2.  Pause the gateway senders on Site A.
<img src="../../images/GF9-WAN-upgrade-2.png" id="image_GF9-WAN-upgrade-2" class="image" />
3.  Upgrade Site B to GemFire 9.0.
<img src="../../images/GF9-WAN-upgrade-3.png" id="image_GF9-WAN-upgrade-3" class="image" />
4.  Start GemFire 9.0 on Site B.
<img src="../../images/GF9-WAN-upgrade-4.png" id="image_GF9-WAN-upgrade-4" class="image" />
5.  Pause the gateway senders on Site B.
<img src="../../images/GF9-WAN-upgrade-5.png" id="image_GF9-WAN-upgrade-5" class="image" />
6.  Start the gateway senders on Site A and wait for Site A's queues to drain.
<img src="../../images/GF9-WAN-upgrade-6.png" id="image_GF9-WAN-upgrade-6" class="image" />
7.  Once the queues have drained sufficiently, reconfigure to redirect all traffic to Site B. Site A's queues should now drain the rest of the way.
<img src="../../images/GF9-WAN-upgrade-7.png" id="image_GF9-WAN-upgrade-7" class="image" />
8.  Upgrade Site A to GemFire 9.0.
<img src="../../images/GF9-WAN-upgrade-8.png" id="image_GF9-WAN-upgrade-8" class="image" />
9.  Once Site A is back up, start Site B's gateway senders and wait for the queues to drain sufficiently.
<img src="../../images/GF9-WAN-upgrade-9.png" id="image_GF9-WAN-upgrade-9" class="image" />
10.  Reconfigure to redistribute the load across both Site A and Site B.
