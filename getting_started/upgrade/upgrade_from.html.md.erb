title:  How To Upgrade
---

Before you upgrade your system, back it up. See [Creating Backups for System Recovery and Operational Management](/geode/managing/disk_storage/backup_restore_disk_store.html) for instructions.

## Upgrade to Version 9 from Version 8.2.3 or a More Recent 8.2 Version

To upgrade all servers from version 8.2.3 or a more recent version of 8.2 to this version of Pivotal
GemFire 9, follow the [Upgrade from Version 8.2 to Version 9](upgrade_gemfire_standalone.html)
procedure.

## Upgrade to Version 9 from Version 8.2.2 or an Earlier Version

All upgrades to this Pivotal GemFire version 9 from Pivotal GemFire versions earlier than version
8.2.3 follow a two-step process:

1. Upgrade all servers to the most recent version of Pivotal GemFire version 8.2.  If possible,
follow the [Rolling Upgrade](rolling_upgrade.html) procedure.  If a rolling upgrade is not possible,
follow the [Off-Line Upgrade](upgrade_offline.html) procedure.

    A rolling upgrade is not possible for a cluster that has partitioned regions without redundancy.
Without the redundancy, region entries will be lost when individual servers are taken out of the
cluster during a rolling upgrade.

2. Upgrade all servers from the most recent version of 8.2 to this version of Pivotal GemFire 9.
Follow the [Upgrade from Version 8.2 to Version 9](upgrade_gemfire_standalone.html) procedure.

## Upgrade to the Latest Version 9 from an Earlier Version 9

If possible, follow the [Rolling Upgrade](rolling_upgrade.html) procedure.  A multi-site
installation can also do rolling upgrades within each site.  If a rolling upgrade is not possible,
follow the [Off-Line Upgrade](upgrade_offline.html) procedure.

A rolling upgrade is not possible for a cluster that has partitioned regions without redundancy.
Without the redundancy, region entries will be lost when individual servers are taken out of the
cluster during a rolling upgrade.

## Upgrade a Multi-Site System to Version 9 from Version 8.2.2 or an Earlier Version

Multi-site systems that have both persistent disk stores and use bidirectional WAN gateways to
replicate data among sites may be able to avoid taking the entire system down to upgrade to version
9.  This [Multi-site Upgrade from Version 8.2 to Version 9](upgrade_multisite.html) procedure
requires multiple reconfigurations during the upgrade as one site at a time is upgraded.
