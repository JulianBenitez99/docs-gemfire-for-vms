procedure.

use bidirectional WAN gateways to replicate data among sites
may be able to avoid taking the entire system down to upgrade
to version 9.
This [Multi-site Upgrade from Version 8.2 to Version 9](upgrade_multisite.html)
procedure requires multiple reconfigurations one site at a time
is upgraded, as the remainder of the system continues running.
