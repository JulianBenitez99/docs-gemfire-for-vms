title:  Before You Upgrade
---

This section provides information you need to know before you begin to
upgrade Pivotal GemFire.

-   Rolling upgrades are not supported for transitioning to Gemfire 9.0.
Therefore, it is important to note that downtime will be required
for an in-place upgrade of each individual GemFire cluster.
Downtime should be scheduled accordingly to reduce complications to
business function.
-   Know how to configure environment variables for your system.
See [Configuring and Running a Cluster](/geode/configuring/chapter_overview.html).
-   Confirm that your system meets the requirements to run GemFire.
See [Supported Configurations and System Requirements](../../supported_configs/supported_configs_and_system_reqs.html).
