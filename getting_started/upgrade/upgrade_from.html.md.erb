title:  Before You Upgrade
---

This section provides information you need to know before you begin to
upgrade Pivotal GemFire.

-   GemFire 9.0.0-beta.1, as its name implies, 
is a beta release suitable for testing.
Do not use this software in a production environment.
-   Rolling upgrades are not supported for transitioning to Gemfire 9.0.
Therefore, it is important to note that downtime will be required
for an in-place upgrade of each individual GemFire cluster.
Downtime should be scheduled accordingly to reduce complications to
business function.
-   Know how to configure environment variables for your system.
-   Confirm that your system meets the requirements to run GemFire.
