<% set_title("Upgrading", product_name_long) %>

To upgrade an existing installation to a new version of <%=vars.product_name_long%>,
follow these general steps:

1. Back up your current system.
1. Install the new version of the software.
1. Stop your distributed system using the current software.
1. Restart the system using the new software.

In many cases, components running under the current version can be stopped selectively, then restarted under the new version 
so that the distributed system as a whole remains functional during the upgrade process; this is known as a "rolling upgrade."

In other cases, the entire system must be stopped in order to accomplish the upgrade, as when
upgrading from one major version to another (for example, from GemFire 8.2 to 9.0), which will
require some downtime for your system.

See [Planning an Upgrade](upgrade_planning.html) to choose the upgrade scenario that best suits your implementation and to understand the resources
you will need to accomplish the upgrade. Then select the appropriate upgrade procedure for more detailed instructions that fit your specific needs.
