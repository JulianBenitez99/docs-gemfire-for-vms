title:  Obtaining Modified Open Source Code Libraries
---

Many open source licenses require that vendors who use or modify their libraries make that code available. GemFire provides these libraries as a downloadable .zip file.

To obtain the open source code libraries modified in GemFire, visit the [Pivotal GemFire product page](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-gemfire). Under File Groups, expand the **Pivotal GemFire Legal Files**. Download **Pivotal GemFire Open Source Files** or the tarball file for a specific GemFire compoment. Download and read the associated License File (.txt) for GemFire or a specific GemFire component from the same download page.

The tarball files contain both the original open source libraries and the modified source libraries.
