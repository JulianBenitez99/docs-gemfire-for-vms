title:  Install Pivotal GemFire from a Homebrew Package
---

If your operating system is macOS, you can install Pivotal GemFire from a Homebrew package.

## Prerequisites

-   Confirm that your system meets the hardware and software requirements described in [Host Machine Requirements](/geode/getting_started/system_requirements/host_machine.html).
In particular, ensure that the host name of your machine is configured
in your system hosts file. 
For example, you may need to map your machine's hostname to your
IP address in the `/etc/hosts` file in order for gfsh and Pulse to
operate correctly.
-   If you have not already done so, download and install a compatible JDK for your system.

## Procedure

1.  From the macOS computer on which you will install GemFire, open a terminal window.
2.  If you previously installed GemFire using Homebrew, execute this untap command to ensure a clean update:

    ``` pre
    $ brew untap pivotal/tap
    ```

3.  In the terminal window, enter this command to install Homebrew, if you have not already installed it:

    ``` pre
    $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    ```

3.  Retap Pivotal:

    ``` pre
    $ brew tap pivotal/tap
    ```

4.  If you are installing GemFire for the first time on this machine, execute the `brew install` command to install GemFire:

    ``` pre
    $ brew install gemfire
    ```

    If you are upgrading an existing GemFire installation, execute the `brew upgrade` command to upgrade GemFire to the latest version:

    ``` pre
    $ brew upgrade gemfire
    ```

    This starts the installation process, resolves dependencies, and displays the packages it will
    install. The GemFire software is installed into the `/usr/local/Cellar/gemfire/VERSION`
    directory where VERSION corresponds to the latest version of GemFire you just installed (for
    example, 9.0.0). Note that Homebrew installs the executables such as `gfsh` in the
    `/usr/local/Cellar/gemfire/version/bin` directory and creates symbolic links to the GemFire
    executables in `/usr/local/bin`. All other GemFire product files including SampleCode and HTTP
    module installers are installed in `/usr/local/Cellar/gemfire/VERSION/libexec`.

5.  Configure your JAVA\_HOME environment variable to point to
a supported version of Java (listed in
[Host Machine Requirements](/geode/getting_started/system_requirements/host_machine.html)).
For example, you can add the following line to your `.bash_profile`:

    ``` pre
    JAVA_HOME='/usr/libexec/java_home -v  1.8'
    ```

6.  Type `gfsh version` at the command line and verify that the output lists the version of Pivotal GemFire that you wished to install. For example:

    ``` pre
    $ gfsh version
    v9.1.1
    ```

    If you want more detailed version information such as the date of the build, build number and JDK version being used, type `gfsh version --full`.

7.  If you need to uninstall GemFire, see [Uninstalling GemFire](uninstall_gemfire.html).
