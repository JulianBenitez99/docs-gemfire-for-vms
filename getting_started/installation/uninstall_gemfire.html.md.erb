This section describes how to remove GemFire.

If you installed Pivotal GemFire from a ZIP file, shut down any running GemFire processes and then simply delete the product tree to uninstall the product. No additional registry entries or system modifications are needed.

If you are using RHEL and installed Pivotal GemFire using RPMs, you can use the `rpm -e` command to uninstall Pivotal GemFire. For example:

``` pre
prompt# sudo rpm -e pivotal-gemfire
```

To uninstall Pivotal GemFire if you are using Mac OSX brew packages, issue the following command:

``` pre
prompt# brew uninstall gemfire
```

If you are using Debian packages, you have two options for uninstalling Pivotal GemFire.

-   `--remove` option will uninstall the product tree, but not the configuration files
-   `--purge` option will uninstall the product tree and the configuration files. You do not need to issue a remove command before a purge.

For example, to remove Pivotal GemFire product tree files:

``` pre
prompt# dpkg --remove pivotal-gemfire
```

To uninstall all Pivotal GemFire files:

``` pre
prompt# dpkg --purge pivotal-gemfire
```
