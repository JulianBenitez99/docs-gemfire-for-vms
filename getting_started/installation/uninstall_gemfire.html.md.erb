title:  Uninstalling GemFire
---

This section describes how to remove GemFire from your system.

**If you installed Pivotal GemFire from a ZIP file,** shut down any running GemFire processes and then simply delete the product tree to uninstall the product. No additional registry entries or system modifications are needed.

**If the old version of GemFire was installed with an RPM,** uninstall using

``` pre
rpm -e Pivotal_GemFire_XXX
```
where `XXX` is replaced by the GemFire version number and also corresponds to the name of the product installation directory.  As an example, the command for removing the GemFire 8.2.5 release would be

``` pre
rpm -e Pivotal_GemFire_825
```

**If the old version of GemFire was installed with DEBs,** uninstall using

``` pre
dpkg --remove pivotal-gemfire
```

**If you installed Pivotal GemFire by using macOS brew packages,** issue the following command:

``` pre
brew uninstall gemfire
```
