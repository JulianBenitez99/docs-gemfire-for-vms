title:  Obtaining Pivotal GemFire from a Maven Repository
---

You can use Maven to add Pivotal GemFire to your Java project build.

To add GemFire to your Java project, you need to modify your project's `pom.xml` file.

1.  

    Add the following repository definition to your `pom.xml` file: 
    ``` pre
    <repositories>
       <repository>
          <id>gemfire-repository</id>
          <name>Gemfire Repository</name>
          <url>http://dist.gemstone.com/maven/release</url>
       </repository>
    </repositories>
    ```

2.  

    Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file: 
    ``` pre
    <dependencies>
       <dependency>
          <groupId>com.gemstone.gemfire</groupId>
          <artifactId>gemfire</artifactId>
          <version>N.N.N</version>
       </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ```

    where *N*.*N*.*N* corresponds to the version of GemFire that you wish to install. For example, **8.2.0**.

**Note:**
You can also obtain Spring Data GemFire using Maven. See [http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-gemfire](http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-gemfire) for instructions. The Spring Data GemFire distribution includes a `gemfire.jar` file; however, this JAR only includes the GemFire Java API and is not a full installation of GemFire.
