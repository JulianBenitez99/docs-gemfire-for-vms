title:  Security
---

The security framework establishes trust between members and authorizes cache operations from clients based on that trust. You establish trust by verifying credentials when one process connects to another.

For example:

-   New members connect to the locator in a peer-to-peer topology.
-   Clients connect to cache servers.
-   One system connects to another in a multi-site system, using mutual authentication.
-   A Diffie-Hellman key exchange encrypts sensitive credentials.

-   **[Pivotal GemFire Security Features](../../../geode/managing/security/security_intro.html)**

    Pivotal GemFire includes a range of built-in authentication and authorization features. It also accommodates security infrastructure plug-ins.

-   **[Security Information Specific to Pivotal GemFire](../../managing/security/security_audit_overview.html)**

    Pivotal is committed to providing products and solutions that allow you to assess the security of your information, secure your information infrastructure, protect your sensitive information, and manage security information and events to assure effectiveness and regulatory compliance.

-   **[Security Implementation Overview](../../../geode/managing/security/implementing_security.html)**

    Pivotal GemFire can authenticate peer system members and clients. It can also authorize cache operations on a server from clients.

-   **[Where to Place Security Settings](../../../geode/managing/security/where_to_place_sec_settings.html)**

    Restrict access to security configuration data by placing related properties (beginning with `security-*`) in a separate file.

-   **[Authentication](../../../geode/managing/security/authentication_overview.html)**

    A distributed system using authentication bars malicious peers or clients, and deters inadvertent access to its cache.

-   **[Authorization](../../../geode/managing/security/authorization_overview.html)**

    Client operations on a cache server can be restricted or completely blocked based on the roles and permissions assigned to the credentials submitted by the client.

-   **[SSL](../../../geode/managing/security/ssl_overview.html)**

    SSL protects your data in transit between applications.

-   **[Multi-Site (WAN) Deployment Security](../../managing/security/security_multisite.html)**

    In addition to peer and client authentication, Pivotal GemFire can authenticate remote sites.
