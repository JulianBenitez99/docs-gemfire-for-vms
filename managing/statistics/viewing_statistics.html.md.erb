title:  Viewing Archived Statistics
---

When sampling and archiving are enabled, you can examine archived historical data to help diagnose performance problems. Study statistics in archive files by using the gfsh `show metrics` command or through the [Visual Statistics Display tool (VSD)](../../tools_modules/vsd/chapter_overview.html) provided with GemFire. The VSD tool reads the sampled statistics and produces graphical displays for analysis.
