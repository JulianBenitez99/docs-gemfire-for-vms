title: Pivotal GemFire Release Notes
---

Pivotal GemFire <%=vars.product_version%> is based on Apache Geode version <%=vars.product_version_geode%>.
Pivotal GemFire <%=vars.product_version%> and Apache Geode share a common set of documentation.
Therefore, references to both GemFire and Apache Geode appear
throughout this documentation; consider them equivalents.

## <a id="topic_whatsnew"></a>What's New in Pivotal GemFire <%=vars.product_version%>

Pivotal GemFire <%=vars.product_version%> includes the following improvements:

- JMX now exposes the free disk space percentage as a statistic.

- A new set of metrics are available through the experimental addition of Micrometer meters. They measure function executions and cache get operations, as well as JVM metrics related to garbage collection, threads, processors, uptime, and file descriptors. Feedback on these metrics is welcomed.

## <a id="topic_InstallingGF910"></a>Installing Pivotal GemFire <%=vars.product_version%>

You can download Pivotal GemFire <%=vars.product_version%> from the [Pivotal GemFire product download](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-gemfire) page.

For details on how to install Pivotal GemFire <%=vars.product_version%>, see [Installing Pivotal GemFire](<%=vars.product_version_nodot%>/gemfire/getting_started/installation/install_intro.html).

## <a id="UpgradingGF910"></a>Upgrading to Pivotal GemFire <%=vars.product_version%>

To upgrade from an earlier version of GemFire to the current version, see [Upgrading Pivotal GemFire](<%=vars.product_version_nodot%>/gemfire/getting_started/upgrade/upgrade_overview.html).

When servers are upgraded to this GemFire version from a version prior to version 9.1.1,
their authentication of client messages is disabled in order to facilitate rolling upgrades.
If your clients are set up to send authenticated messages, the servers will honor those messages,
but will not enforce authentication until you reinstate authentication on each of the upgraded servers.

To reinstate secure client/server messaging, restart each server with
the `geode.disallow-internal-messages-without-credentials` system property set to `true`.
For example:

``` pre
gfsh>start server --name=server_name --dir=server_config_dir \
--J=-Dgeode.disallow-internal-messages-without-credentials=true
```

## <a id="ResolvedIssues"></a>Resolved Issues

(https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GEODE/Release+Notes#ReleaseNotes-1.11.0).
Ticket numbers of the form GEODE&#8209;NNNN can be inspected at the
[Apache Software Foundation site for Geode issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE).


### <a id="ResolvedIssuesGF910"></a>Issues Resolved in Pivotal GemFire <%=vars.product_version%>

**GEODE-7465, GEM-2773:** Fixed an issue that threw `RegionDestroyedException` when an asynchronous event queue was stopped and then restarted.

**GEODE-7473, GEM-2774:** Fixed a memory leak in the accumulation of entry event objects that could occur when a gateway receiver existed for the same region as a gateway sender.

**GEODE-7593, GEM-2795:** Fixed a memory leak that caused a higher than expected heap size when eviction was enabled.  The issue was due to indexes that retained references to serialized values when the indexed key was a PDX string.

**GEODE-7374, GEM-2748:** GemFire no longer throws a `ClassCastException` when using the deprecated `MemberCommandService`.

**GEODE-7373, GEM-2746:** Enforce JMX credentials to be either a string or an array of strings.

**GEODE-7036, GEM-2723:** Fixed a bug that could result in a `NullPointerException` when restarting members and a locator rejoins the cluster to form a quorum.

**GEODE-7264, GEM-2706:** Updated the Jackson dependency to version 2.10.0.

**GEODE-7334, GEM-2705:** GemFire no longer throws a `ClassCastException` when the developer REST API is enabled and `JodaModule` is in the classpath.

**GEODE-7208, GEM-2698:** Fixed Lucene index creation when there are non-primitive fields in a child class, and the fields are defined in the parent class.

**GEODE-7268, GEM-2692:** A `gfsh alter region` no longer causes a soft hang when many gateway senders exist, by making the gfsh command implementation work more like the equivalent Java API.

**GEODE-7535, GEM-2654:** Fixed a race condition that could improperly result in an `EntryDestroyedException` during a `getAll` operation, if a client proxy region exists and there are no transactions.

**GEODE-7085, GEM-2647:** Eliminated an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` while recovering values from disk when the region version value overflowed.

**GEODE-7015, GEM-2604:** Fixed a bug that could result in a hung server if a move bucket operation failed during rebalance due to a forced disconnect with recreated persistent partitioned regions.

**GEODE-7042:** The server launcher now waits until all of the server's startup tasks have completed before updating the server's status to "online". The `ServerLauncher.start()` method now blocks until redundancy recovery and recovery of values from disk have completed. This change has the effect of making the `gfsh start server` command wait for all server startup tasks to complete before returning.

**GEODE-4993:** GatewaySender connection statistics are now stored after being captured.
