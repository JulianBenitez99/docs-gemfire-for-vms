title: VMware GemFire Release Notes
---

Pivotal GemFire is now <%=vars.product_name_long%>.

<%=vars.product_name%> <%=vars.product_version%> is based on Apache Geode version <%=vars.product_version_geode%>,
so it also includes features and bug fixes from Apache Geode version 1.11.
<%=vars.product_name%> <%=vars.product_version%> and Apache Geode share a common set of documentation.
Therefore, references to both <%=vars.product_name%> and Apache Geode appear
throughout this documentation; consider them equivalents.

## <a id="topic_whatsnew-9101"></a>What's New in <%=vars.product_name%> 9.10.1

<%=vars.product_name%> 9.10.1 is a maintenance release that resolves a variety of issues&mdash;see
[Issues Resolved in <%=vars.product_name%> 9.10.1](#ResolvedIssuesGF9101) for more information.

## <a id="topic_whatsnew-910"></a>What's New in <%=vars.product_name%> 9.10

<%=vars.product_name%> <%=vars.product_version%> includes the following improvements:

- JMX now exposes the free disk space percentage as a statistic.

- Asynchronous event queues may now be created in a paused state.
This allows better control of event dispatch,
as the dispatch may be delayed until the application is ready for event consumption.

- The new pluggable OQL security framework restrict which classes and methods can be
called from queries.
A system administrator can change the security posture at runtime.
Provided implementations cover several use cases, as described in
[Method Invocation Authorizers](/geode/managing/security/method_invocation_authorizers.html).

- There are new endpoints in the REST API for Management, including create and delete index,
list deployed jars, show PDX configuration, and show the supported REST API versions.

## <a id="topic_InstallingGF910"></a>Installing <%=vars.product_name%> <%=vars.product_version%>

You can download <%=vars.product_name%> <%=vars.product_version%> from the [<%=vars.product_name%> product download](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-gemfire) page.

For details on how to install <%=vars.product_name%> <%=vars.product_version%>, see [Installing <%=vars.product_name%>](<%=vars.product_version_nodot%>/gemfire/getting_started/installation/install_intro.html).

## <a id="UpgradingGF910"></a>Upgrading to <%=vars.product_name%> <%=vars.product_version%>

To upgrade from an earlier version of <%=vars.product_name%> to the current version, see [Upgrading <%=vars.product_name%>](<%=vars.product_version_nodot%>/gemfire/getting_started/upgrade/upgrade_overview.html).

When servers are upgraded to this <%=vars.product_name%> version from a version prior to version 9.1.1,
their authentication of client messages is disabled in order to facilitate rolling upgrades.
If your clients are set up to send authenticated messages, the servers will honor those messages,
but will not enforce authentication until you reinstate authentication on each of the upgraded servers.

To reinstate secure client/server messaging, restart each server with
the `geode.disallow-internal-messages-without-credentials` system property set to `true`.
For example:

``` pre
gfsh>start server --name=server_name --dir=server_config_dir \
--J=-Dgeode.disallow-internal-messages-without-credentials=true
```

## <a id="ResolvedIssues"></a>Resolved Issues

The <%=vars.product_name%> <%=vars.product_version%> release is based on the Apache Geode <%=vars.product_version_geode%> release, which also includes bug fixes from the Apache Geode 1.11 release.
This section describes issue resolutions that significantly affect <%=vars.product_name%> applications.
For a list of all issues resolved in Apache Geode <%=vars.product_version_geode%>, see the [Geode <%=vars.product_version_geode%> Release Notes]
(https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GEODE/Release+Notes#ReleaseNotes-1.12.0).
For a list of all issues resolved in Apache Geode 1.11, see the [Geode 1.11 Release Notes]
(https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GEODE/Release+Notes#ReleaseNotes-1.11.0).
Ticket numbers of the form GEODE&#8209;NNNN can be inspected at the
[Apache Software Foundation site for Geode issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE).


### <a id="ResolvedIssuesGF9101"></a>Issues Resolved in <%=vars.product_name%> 9.10.1

**GEODE-7851:** Pulse logging has been restored.

**GEODE-7940:** Fixed a problem in which a parallel GatewaySender stopped sending events if another GatewaySender attached to the same region was destroyed.

**GEODE-8055, GEM-2890:** Indexes can now be created on subregions.

**GEODE-8071, GEM-2896:** Changed the thread type used when executing the gfsh rebalance command to prevent locators from hanging during shutdown.

**GEODE-8091, GEM-2898:** Locator failed to start after upgrade to v9.10 if a deprecated feature was in use. Support for the deprecated feature has been restored to allow startup to proceed.

### <a id="ResolvedIssuesGF910"></a>Issues Resolved in <%=vars.product_name%> 9.10

**GEODE-7465, GEM-2773:** Fixed an issue that threw `RegionDestroyedException` when an asynchronous event queue was stopped and then restarted.

**GEODE-7473, GEM-2774:** Fixed a memory leak in the accumulation of entry event objects that could occur when a gateway receiver existed for the same region as a gateway sender.

**GEODE-7593, GEM-2795:** Fixed a memory leak that caused a higher than expected heap size when eviction was enabled.  The issue was due to indexes that retained references to serialized values when the indexed key was a PDX string.

**GEODE-7374, GEM-2748:** <%=vars.product_name%> no longer throws a `ClassCastException` when using the deprecated `MemberCommandService`.

**GEODE-7373, GEM-2746:** Enforce JMX credentials to be either a string or an array of strings.

**GEODE-7036, GEM-2723:** Fixed a bug that could result in a `NullPointerException` when restarting members and a locator rejoins the cluster to form a quorum.

**GEODE-7264, GEM-2706:** Updated the Jackson dependency to version 2.10.0.

**GEODE-7334, GEM-2705:** <%=vars.product_name%> no longer throws a `ClassCastException` when the developer REST API is enabled and `JodaModule` is in the classpath.

**GEODE-7208, GEM-2698:** Fixed Lucene index creation when there are non-primitive fields in a child class, and the fields are defined in the parent class.

**GEODE-7268, GEM-2692:** A `gfsh alter region` no longer causes a soft hang when many gateway senders exist, by making the gfsh command implementation work more like the equivalent Java API.

**GEODE-7535, GEM-2654:** Fixed a race condition that could improperly result in an `EntryDestroyedException` during a `getAll` operation, if a client proxy region exists and there are no transactions.

**GEODE-7085, GEM-2647:** Eliminated an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` while recovering values from disk when the region version value overflowed.

**GEODE-7015, GEM-2604:** Fixed a bug that could result in a hung server if a move bucket operation failed during rebalance due to a forced disconnect with recreated persistent partitioned regions.

**GEODE-7042:** The server launcher now waits until all of the server's startup tasks have completed before updating the server's status to "online". The `ServerLauncher.start()` method now blocks until redundancy recovery and recovery of values from disk have completed. This change has the effect of making the `gfsh start server` command wait for all server startup tasks to complete before returning.

**GEODE-4993:** GatewaySender connection statistics are now stored after being captured.

**GEODE-6973:** Improved creation time  performance when there are a large number of PDX types. 

**GEODE-7628, GEM-2747:** Block JMX MBean creation when no `SecurityManager` interface is implemented.

**GEODE-7755, GEM-2614:** Fixed a bug that resulted in locator processes continuing to run even when the logs show them shut down.

**GEODE-7728, GEM-2819:** Fixed an exception thrown when executing an equi-join query and both fields are indexed.

**GEODE-7294:** Moved to Spring 5 and updated other third-party libraries
to their latest security patch versions.

**GEODE-7310:** Fixed an issue in which taking a backup was not properly aborted if a member of the distributed system was lost during the backup process.

**GEODE-7750, GEODE-7760, GEODE-7796, GEM-2821, GEM-2823:**
Fixed an issue which could cause a locator to fail to restart properly, and also corrupted the cluster configuration.

**GEODE-7763:** Reduced the performance degradation caused when a client has multiple threads, and each client thread does operations on the same region key.
