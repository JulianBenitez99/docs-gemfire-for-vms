## <a id="topic_whatsnew-91015"></a>What's New in Tanzu GemFire 9.15

GemFire/Geode Realignment
:    GemFire 9.15 is based on Geode 1.15. The previous release of GemFire, v9.10, was based on Geode 1.12.
With the GemFire 9.15 release, GemFire now incorporates all of the improvements introduced in Geode versions 1.13, 1.14, and 1.15.

Token Refresh
:    This release introduces additional security by including the ability to force connections to
refresh their authentications.  When a client is connected and the authentication token has expired,
the client now must provide a new or refreshed token in order to continue.

Default GemFire property value changed
:    The `conserve-sockets` GemFire property's default value has been changed from `true` to `false`.

GEODE-9982, GEM-3509: protocol alignment/client-server handshake fix
:    GemFire Native Client applications must be upgraded to at least version 10.2.7 before upgrading the GemFire server to v9.15.

Connection Reauthorization
:    GemFire security has been improved by implemented authentication expiration. Authentication expiry makes it possible for
cluster administrators to limit the life span of client and peer connections within the cluster.
See [Implementing Authentication Expiry](/geode/managing/security/implementing_authentication_expiry.html) for details.
