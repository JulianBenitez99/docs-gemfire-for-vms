## <a id="topic_whatsnew-91015"></a>What's New in Tanzu GemFire 9.15

GemFire/Geode Realignment
:    GemFire 9.15 is based on Geode 1.15. The previous release of GemFire, v9.10, was based on Geode 1.12.
With the GemFire 9.15 release, GemFire now incorporates all of the improvements introduced in Geode versions 1.13, 1.14, and 1.15.

Token Refresh
:    This release introduces additional security by including the ability for tokens to refresh.  When a client is connected and the authentication token has expired,
the client now must provide a new or refreshed token in order to continue.

GemFire for Redis Apps
:    GemFire can now be used with Redis clients.  This offers the consistency and
high-availablity of GemFire with minimal changes needed to port existing applications using Redis.  This
first release offers compatibility for more than 100 Redis commands, including Strings, Hashes,
Sets, Sorted Sets, and Pub/Sub.  To get started check out the documentation.

Default GemFire property value changed
:    The `conserve-sockets` GemFire property's default value has been changed from `true` to `false`.

GEODE-9982, GEM-3509: protocol alignment/client-server handshake fix
:    GemFire Native Client applications must be upgraded to at least version 10.2.7 before upgrading the GemFire server to v9.15.

Tanzu Observability
:    The prometheus metrics jars are on the classpath for 9.15, so no longer need to be loaded explicitly.

Connection Reauthorization
:    GemFire security has been improved by by requiring existing connections to re-authorize when an application or administrator has their permissions revoked,
even though the connection was initiated before the auth revocation.
