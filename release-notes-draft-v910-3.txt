Tanzu GemFire 9.10.3 Pre-Release Notes
Draft Date: September 11, 2020
============================
Tanzu GemFire 9.10.3 is a maintenance release that resolves a variety of issues.
Tanzu GemFire 9.10.3 is based on Apache Geode version 1.12.

Issues Resolved in Tanzu GemFire 9.10.3
---------------------------------------
GEODE-6564, GEM-3001: Fixed a memory leak that occurred when a replicated region, configured with
entry expiration, was cleared.

GEODE-8331: Fixed an issue that prevented gfsh v1.12 from connecting to a Geode v1.10 (GemFire
9.9.0) server. If a Geode v1.10 command is incompatible with the newer version of gfsh, it will fail
with a detailed error message.

GEODE-8394, GEM-2989: Fixed an issue in which putAll operations or put operations with large objects
could result in data corruption if invoked without having a sufficiently large
read-timeout. Subsequent get operations or queries could experience failures due to this corruption.

Issues in Progress, expected in this release
--------------------------------------------
GEODE-8483, GEM-3004: Introduced a correction to JCA transaction logic that restores the ability of
the system to detect commit conflict exceptions in concurrent access situations.
